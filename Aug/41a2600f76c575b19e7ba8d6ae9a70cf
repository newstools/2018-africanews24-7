JOHANNESBURG, August 1 – South Africa’s power utility, Eskom, on Wednesday, said that the risk of Stage 1 rotational load shedding remained high but will only be implemented if “absolutely necessary”. Eskom said it did not implement load shedding on Wednesday morning, adding that the electricity system remained constrained with a high probability of Stage 1 rotational load shedding on Wednesday night from 5 pm to 10 pm, as a result of industrial action. “Eskom and organised labour will meet at the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) [on Wednesday] today to resolve the impasse. We are hopeful that all parties will put South Africa first as we endeavour in finding an amicable solution. The South African Police Services continue to maintain order and enable safe access to power stations as these are National Key Points,” Eskom said. “Eskom will advise if load shedding will be conducted in either stage 1, stage 2, stage 3 or stage 4, dependent on the capacity shortage. Stage 1 requires 1000MW to be rotationally load-shed nation-wide, stage 2 requires 2000MW, stage 3 requires 3000MW and stage 4 calls for up to 4000MW to be rotationally load-shed nationally at a given period. Loadshedding is conducted rotationally as a measure of last resort to protect the power system from a total collapse or blackout.” Eskom encouraged residents and businesses to use electricity sparingly to ease the demand, including switching off geysers during times of non-use, as well as all non-essential lighting and electricity appliances to assist in reducing demand. – African News Agency (ANA)
