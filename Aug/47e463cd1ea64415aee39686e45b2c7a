Ramaphosa, the ever-smiling ANC and caretaker SA president seven months into completing his predecessor’s term, looks a forlorn one. He is today a long shot from the brimming, walking guy who had swag. It looks like his honeymoon was extremely short-lived. Given the conflicting and real pressures of leading SA, its caretaker president this week found himself having to shore up to convince ANC members and supporters that he was serious with the land debate.  Don’t forget he became president by the slimmest of margins and internally appears not to be able to shake that. Initially, with tons of selfies in commercial flights, morning walks on the Sea-Point beachfront with broad smiles it looked like he would have a long honeymoon. Ramaphosa finds himself today the scorn of those who loved him and saw him as the messiah of SA. Today he is pilloried with white fury, legitimate black anger, mistrust by some from a former era while his strategy and tactics are questioned even by the clever blacks. But why are they angry with President Ramaphosa? Don’t they know Ramaphosa must win an election? Hitherto he has won no election and remains a caretaker president not endorsed by any ballot. It goes without saying that uppermost in Ramaphosa’s mind is the winning of an election. His very challenge emanates from the fact that his predecessors were all endorsed with a minimum of 62%+ vote. It is anticipated the ANC under his leadership faces the real threat of coalition politics. Shall we then attempt to engage what drives Ramaphosa in this season in which his delivery of the lekgotla land statement is a microcosm? Here are my twelve reasons to understand and interpret Ramaphosa’s actions:             Honestly speaking, I would hate to be in Ramaphosa shoes – he has loads of pressure on him. Whatever he does he appears doomed because he essentially has no unique position but a mandated ANC one on land. His primary task is to honour the mandate of the ANC that voted him into ANC presidency. He has to resist the temptation of being seen as separate from the ANC as so often demanded by those who do not vote ANC. In a nutshell, he does this land statement reluctantly, yet compelled to own up, because he does not necessarily share its radical sentiments at a personal level.  If he had his way he would have never endorsed tampering with the constitution, after all, it is his major claim to fame for some. President Ramaphosa in a strange twist of events is learning that being liked by apartheid-defined whites means absolutely nothing but a selfie moment. To win an election you must respond to the challenges of the constituency that made you president. Unless you are ready to have a short stay and be reduced like Motlanthe to an eternal caretaker president. Ramaphosa finds himself hated and distrusted while we continue to keep the ANC leadership to their adopted resolutions and any diluting will be challenged. Not honouring and working, sleeping, dreaming and speaking ANC resolutions may render him unfit to lead the ANC.  I wish him all the best, while we know with this statement he has fewer supporters from those who make up the apartheid beneficiaries, a very challenging thing for someone who thrives on being liked. Welcome to the real world of politics Bra’ Cyril, white interest doesn’t vote ANC, they love separating ANC leaders from their organisation to benefit white privilege. Beware not to be hoodwinked into thinking they will vote for you if you have any hope of winning your maiden election please focus on those who mandated you to lead their organisation.
