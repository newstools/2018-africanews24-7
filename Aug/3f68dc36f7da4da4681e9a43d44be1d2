JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) â€“ South African platinum producer Royal Bafokeng Platinum said on Monday its half-year loss narrowed but was still weighed down by an impairment cost, care and maintenance costs and operational readiness costs from its newly acquired Maseve operations. The firm reported a headline loss per share of 6 cents for the six months ended June 30, compared with a loss per share of 15.3 cents a year ago. HEPS is the main profit gauge in South Africa, which strips out certain one-off items.  (Reporting by Tanisha Heiberg; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier)
