JOHANNESBURG, August 28 – British Prime Minister Theresa May on Tuesday said she is to meet with South Africa President Cyril Ramaphosa on land reform. Addressing business leaders from both countries in Cape Town, May said the UK has for some time supported land reform which is being done in a legal and transparent manner and is generated through a democratic process. “It is an issue that I raised and discussed with President Ramaphosa when he was in London earlier this year and I will be talking to him about it later today, but I welcome the comments that he has already made about us approaching land reform bearing in mind the economic social consequences,” May said. May further added that significant investment from the UK is already being seen in South Africa and that there are real opportunities for the future. “I brought a significant business delegation with me here across a wide range of business activity, from financial service to agricultural products, manufacturing and infrastructure and technology companies as well, and as I said, we look across the whole of Africa as people are looking to invest they want to ensure that their countries have the sort of stable aspect that investors are always looking for,” said May. May’s visit to South Africa will likely centre on how trade relations might be impacted by her country’s imminent exit from the European Union. The visit, her first to Africa as Prime Minister, will also take her to Kenya and Nigeria, making her the first British leader to visit the sub-Saharan region since 2013. May’s office said at the weekend the tour was a unique opportunity “as the UK moves towards Brexit, for a truly Global Britain to invest in and work alongside African nations, with mutual benefits”. – African News Agency (ANA)
