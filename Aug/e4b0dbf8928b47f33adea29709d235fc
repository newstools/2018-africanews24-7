GRAAFF-REINET, August 25 – Pan Africanist Congress factional battles came to the fore at the funeral of anti-apartheid activist Zondeni Veronica Sobukwe at Graaff-Reinet in the Eastern Cape on Saturday morning. One PAC faction prevented the leader of another faction, Narius Moloto, from entering the church venue for the funeral. The faction claimed Moloto was not welcome, as he was “not a PAC representative”. He was escorted out of the venue while the leader of another faction Luthando Mbinda was not disturbed. Speaking to the African News Agency (ANA) after the incident, Moloto said this was the work of the hooligans who came to disrupt the funeral. “In PAC there are hooligans; this incident is the work of the hooligans who came here for the purpose of disrupting the moment where we should be paying our last respects,” Moloto said. Many mourners turned up to bid farewell to Sobukwe, whom they referred to as the “mother of Azania”. Deputy President David Mabuza is expected to deliver the eulogy. Sobukwe, a widow of PAC founder Robert Sobukwe, reportedly died at the age of 91 at her home in Graaff-Reinet last Wednesday. – African News Agency (ANA)
