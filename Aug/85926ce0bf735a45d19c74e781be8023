JOHANNESBURG, August 30 – The mayor of Tshwane Solly Msimanga will likely lose his livery collar if the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and the African National Congress (ANC) carry out their threats to band together in a confidence motion to be tabled Thursday. Msimanga, a member of the Democratic Alliance (DA) has incurred the wrath of the EFF and the ANC who has accused him of presiding over corruption. The DA has asked its supporters to come into the streets in Pretoria to demonstrate their support for beleaguered Msimanga. There is a heavy police presence in the capital ahead of the confidence motion. – African News Agency (ANA)
