JOHANNESBURG, August 16 – A Nigerian presidential aspirant, from incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari’s ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) party, has heaped scorn on comments by the president that the international community is impressed with his leadership. Vanguard reported on Thursday that in a Wednesday statement Dr Sylvester Ogbonna countered Buhari’s confidence saying that the consensus among world powers was that the incumbent’s second term ambition lacked popular support. “My campaign has been crisscrossing the globe in the past weeks, consulting with fellow Nigerians as well as influential leaders among our major allies, including Britain, the United States, France, Germany, Russia, China, and Canada among others,” said Ogbonna. “I can state unequivocally that the emerging consensus among these nations is that President Buhari’s second term ambition lacks cogency.” Ogbonna said the international community pointed to Buhari’s failing health, lack of clear vision, lack of intellectual capacity, nepotism, wanton killings, disregard to rule of law, and a growing sense of disunity and uncertainty in the land, among many failings. – African News Agency (ANA)
