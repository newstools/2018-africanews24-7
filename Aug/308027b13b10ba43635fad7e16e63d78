DAR-ES-SALAAM (Reuters) – Former Barcelona and Nigeria winger Emmanuel Amunike has signed a two-year contract as the new national team coach of Tanzania, the country’s football association said on Monday. He will start next month when Tanzania travel to neighbours Uganda to play a 2019 African Nations Cup qualifier. Amunike, 47, was a member of FIFA’s five-man technical study group at the World Cup in Russia last month, working alongside Marco van Basten and Carlos Alberto Parreira. He replaces Salum Mayanga as Tanzania coach and will also take charge of all their junior national teams, officials said. Amunike’s last coaching job was at club level in Sudan but in 2015 he took Nigeria to the U-17 World Cup title in Chile. He played for Nigeria at the 1994 World Cup and earlier that year scored the two goals that helped them win the Nations Cup final in Tunisia. He was also an Olympic gold medallist with Nigeria’s under-23 team in Atlanta in 1996. At club level he also played for Portuguese club Sporting.
