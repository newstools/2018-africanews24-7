JOHANNESBURG, August 13 (ANA) – Thousands of Muslim fundamentalists protested over the weekend in front of the Tunisia Parliament to decry proposals in a government report on gender equality that they claim are contrary to Islam, AP reported. They marched from Tunis to Bardo, outside the capital where the parliament is located, to protest the report by the Commission of Individual Liberties and Equality. The report, among other things, calls for legalising homosexuality and giving the sexes equal inheritance rights. – African News Agency (ANA)
