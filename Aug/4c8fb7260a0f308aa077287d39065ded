Staff Reporter JOHANNESBURG- Women from the Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD) on Tuesday marched from the Florida fire station to Martindale public safety headquarters to raise awareness on women. The JMPD women were joined by women in Emergency Services, Disaster Management, Joburg Road Agency and those from the licensing department in the city of Joburg. “We’re gathered here at the Florida fire station, people are saying we are marching… no, we are not, we are walking for awareness on women issues,” said JMPD spokeswoman Superintendent Edna Mamonyane. According to Ms Enda Mamonyane, the JMPD is a male-dominated department. Mamonyane added that their memorandum which was accepted by the chief of JMPD David Tembe included issues of equal rights for all, domestic abuse and gender-based workplace violence. About 500 women marched for a distance of 8 kilometres and the Kenny Kunene foundation was one of the sponsors of the event.
