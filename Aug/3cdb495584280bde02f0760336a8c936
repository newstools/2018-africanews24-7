PARLIAMENT, August 13 – Parliament’s justice committee on Monday said a finding by the Constitutional Court that the appointment of national director of public prosecutions Shaun Abrahams was invalid closed a “long-drawn out chapter” in the affairs of the National Prosecuting Authority. “This has led to uncertainty at the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA). The focus should now revert back to stability and certainty at the NPA,” committee chairman Mathole Motshekga said in a statement. MPs would now focus on amending the NPA act, as ordered by the Constitutional Court,” said Motshekga “I note that subsections 12(4) and 12(6) have been declared unconstitutional. I, as chairperson, will do everything in my power to ensure that an amendment of the Act happens speedily as we want to ensure a strong and constitutionally sound legislation.” Section 12 of the NPA act deals with the term of office of the national prosecutions boss.
