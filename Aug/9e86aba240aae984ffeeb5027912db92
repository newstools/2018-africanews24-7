Solly Makganoto Mpumalanga police on Wednesday confirmed that they are investigating a defamation case against an ANC member who was reported to have called Deputy President David Mabuza  murderer. This was after Mabuza laid a criminal charge of defamation at Mpumalanga’s Embalenhle police station against an ANC opponent who last week was reported to have called him a murderer and said his successor as provincial premier, Refilwe Mtshweni, was his girlfriend. “Currently the case is being investigated on behalf of the complainant who in this case is Mr David Mabuza and once the investigation is done, then it will be presented to the prosecutor for prosecution” said Brigadier Leonard Hlanti. Last week Africa News 24-7 published a video in which an ANC Mpumalanga supporter accused Deputy President David ‘DD’ Mabuza of being a murderer and a womaniser. The man, who supports David Dube to take over as ANC provincial chairperson at the provincial general council (PGC) in September, did not take kindly to Mabuza’s endorsement of the current acting provincial chairperson, Mandla Ndlovu. In the video Bishop Hangwi Maumela, who leads the Faith Harvest Bible Church can be heard revealing long-standing allegations that Mabuza has murdered political opponents and he claimed Mtshweni was appointed Mpumalanga premier because she was Mabuza’s girlfriend. Maumela told Africa News 24-7 that no one has communicated to him either in paper or telephonically regarding the defamation case. “I can’t comment on something I don’t know, at this stage no one has communicated to me,” said Maumela. “I know nothing about a defamation case opened against me by the deputy president”.
