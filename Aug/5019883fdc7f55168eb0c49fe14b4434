MARIKANA, August 16 -The stage is set for the sixth anniversary of the Marikana massacre commemoration in Marikana, Rustenburg in North West province. A giant white marquee has been pitched near the infamous koppie (small hill) in Nkaneng informal settlement, with steel barriers for crowd control erected around the marquee and the stage, while two giant screens to beam proceedings at the stage had been set up and the ground cleared of shrubs. August 16, marked the sixth year after 34 Lonmin mineworkers were killed when the police shot them during a week-long wild cat strike for a minimum monthly salary of R12, 500. Ten other people including two Lonmin security officers and two policemen were killed in days leading to the August 16, 2012 deadly shooting. Thousands of people including political leaders were expected to attend the commemoration with Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu) president Joseph Mathunjwa delivering the main address. Mathunjwa has called for August 16 to be declared a public holiday in honour of the slain mineworkers. This year Amcu boycotted the Workers’Day celebrations on May 1, arguing that the day should be shifted to August 16. On Wednesday, one of the widows of the killed miners, Aisha Fundi called on President Cyril Ramaphosa to intervene in the deepening division between two groups of Marikana widows. She said the families of the ten people killed prior to August 16 were being over looked, and wanted Ramaphosa to clarify who was responsible for paying  compensation to the ten families. (ANA)
