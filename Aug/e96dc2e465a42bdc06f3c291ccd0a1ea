JOHANNESBURG, August 6 – Rhodes University Vice-Chancellor Dr Sizwe Mabizela on Monday had the institution’s flag at half mast in honour of Khensani Maseko, allegedly committed suicide after she was raped by her boyfriend. The 23-year-old student, who was allegedly raped by her then-boyfriend in May, was found dead at her family home in Johannesburg on Friday afternoon. It is thought that she committed suicide. The University said it would request the South African Police Service and National Prosecuting Authority to initiate an inquest into Maseko’s death and that they would issue an intention to suspend the alleged perpetrator. The  SRC of which Maseko was a member, has expressed shock at her sudden passing. She was also a member of the Economic Freedom Fighters Student Command. Students from the University posted tributes on social media for the third-year BA student, who many said was never the same after the attack. – African News Agency (ANA)
