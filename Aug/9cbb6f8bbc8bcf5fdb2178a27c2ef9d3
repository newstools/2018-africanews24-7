LONDON (Reuters) – Fulham have broken their transfer record to sign Cameroonian defensive midfielder Andre-Frank Anguissa from Olympique de Marseille, the Premier League club said on Thursday. The 22-year-old, who British newspapers reported cost 22.3 million pounds ($28.6 million), agreed a five-year-deal with newly promoted Fulham subject to being granted a work permit. “Andre’s tremendous data profile, his glowing scouting reports, and his sterling reputation confirm his world class talent,” Fulham director of football operations Tony Khan told the club website. “Throughout this summer, we’ve pursued elite players on whom we believed we could rely to deliver the quality required to challenge the great competition we’ll face in the Premier League, and thus, Andre has been one of our top targets.” Anguissa joined Marseille in 2015, helping them finish fourth in Ligue 1 last season and reach the Europa League final. “I am delighted to have signed for Fulham today. This is a new chapter in my career and one I’m really looking forward to,” Anguissa said. “I hope to bring my qualities to this new project. I like a challenge and I will ensure that I give my very best to my team, the Club, and the supporters.” Anguissa made his Cameroon debut in 2017 and has played 11 times for his country.
