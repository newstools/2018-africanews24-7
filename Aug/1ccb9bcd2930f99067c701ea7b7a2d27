CAPE TOWN, August 19 – Although under-funded, the South African Traditional Music Awards (Satma) has injected R13 million into the North West economy, according to founder Dumisani Goba. “Last year [2017], the Satma invested R13 million to the economy of North West,” Goba said at the official announcement of 2018 awards nominees in Cape Town on Saturday night. “We remain under-funded… It pains me to see people standing like this because we cannot have a bigger venue,” he said. A number of people were left having to stand in the function hall because of limited seating. The 13th annual Satma winners will be announced in Mahikeng in the North West on September 29. Goba said over 1000 entries had been received and 76,000 votes cast. The up-and-coming category alone had 300 entries. All nominees would have a “code” which members of the public could use to vote via an SMS. Voting would open on August 19 and close on September 18. North West tourism MEC Desbo Mohono said the province was ready to welcome people attending the Satma ceremony, and encouraged them to come to the province a week earlier. (ANA)
