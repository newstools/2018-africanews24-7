JOHANNESBURG, August 21 – Multichoice has pulled the plug on Afro Worldview – the television channel formerly owned by the Gupta brothers under the name ANN7 – which until Monday night had been aired on DSTV 405. Earlier in January MultiChoice CEO Calvo Mawela said “mistakes” were made in contractual negotiations with the formerly Gupta-owned 24-hour news channel ANN7 and that the agreement will be terminated when the deal expires on 20 August. He said the channel, which has since changed ownership and name, will no longer be carried on DStv after that date. Staff at the broadcaster have been informed not to report for work from Tuesday. (ANA)
