PORT ELIZABETH, August 3 – Four people charged with the murder of electrician Petrus Scholtz, 70, appeared in the Port Elizabeth Magistrate’s Court on Friday where the case against them was postponed for a formal bail application. Russouw family members – mother Christine Russouw, 55, her children Chantell, 35, and Wayne, 31 were arrested and charged with Scholtz’s murder after his body was found dumped in Fairview last month. A fourth person, Roland Swartz, also appeared alongside the Russouw family in connection with the elderly man’s murder. Swartz is being represented by judiciary while the Russouw family are being represented by legal aid. The body of Scholtz was found dumped along a gravel road in Fairview on July 19. His body was discovered severely beaten, with his hands and feet bound. He appeared to have been strangled with a cord and his head was covered in cling-wrap, police said at the time. It is alleged that Scholtz was lured to a house where the killing took place. It further emerged that he was thrown into a freezer before his body was dumped. The Russouw family members are also facing a charge of robbery with aggravating circumstances after Scholtz’s Izuzu bakkie was taken by force, the charge sheet reads. Christine and Chantell had their hair braided and chatted with one another while waiting inside the courtroom. Meanwhile, Wayne complained that he had spoken to correctional services officials informing them that he needed medication for depression. “I have spoken to them about my depression medication but they have done zero about it,” he said. Magistrate Thuli Betela, for the second time, ordered that he be taken to a hospital. The case was postponed until August 14 – African News Agency (ANA)
