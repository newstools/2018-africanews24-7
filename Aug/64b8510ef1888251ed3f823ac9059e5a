PRETORIA, August 30 – Embattled Tshwane Mayor walked into the Council chambers around on Thursday morning, where he will fight for his job as opposition parties bring motions of no confidence in him. Msimanga’s coalition partners, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), and the African National Congress (ANC) have raised displeasure with the incumbent, threatening to remove him on Thursday via the motions of no confidence. A jovial-looking Msimanga waved ANC head of caucus in Council, Mapiti Matsini who was on the other side of the hall. Msimanga, a member of the Democratic Alliance (DA) has incurred the wrath of the EFF and the ANC who has accused him of presiding over corruption and maladministration. Outside Council chambers, DA leader Mmusi Maimane was addressing a crowd of supporters, pledging support for Msimanga. On another side, EFF councillors were singing and dancing with some members of the ANC. The DA has asked its supporters to come into the streets in Pretoria to demonstrate their support for beleaguered Msimanga. Several police units were stationed outside the Council chambers. Several water cannons and other trucks carryings rolls of barbed wire were also in the vicinity. – African News Agency (ANA)
