Staff Reporter The Mercedes-Benz Stadium is a multi-purpose retractable roof stadium located in Atlanta, Georgia.  The new Mercedes-Benz stadium is extraordinary. The stunning structure is home to the Atlanta Falcons, Atlanta United and is a destination venue for major concerts and other events and was conceived with one constituency foremost in mind: the fans. Mercedes-Benz Stadium is shiny, new and impressive — from the stadium’s retractable roof and huge oval video board shows all-important shots of sellout crowds for MLS Atlanta United. Atlanta’s burgeoning soccer scene was featured in North America’s successful bid for 2026 World Cup. The video evidence helped sway FIFA to overwhelmingly approve the bid from the United States, Mexico and Canada. The bid suggested Atlanta and Dallas as host sites for 2026 semifinals, and Atlanta United season ticket-holder Ken Harper can’t wait. The World Cup will return to the U.S. for the first time since 1994.
