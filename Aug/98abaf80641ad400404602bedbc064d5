JOHANNESBURG, August 15 – Public broadcast SABC and MultiChoice said they had signed a new commercial channel supply agreement allowing the SABC News and SABC Encore channels to continue to be broadcast on the DStv platform. The agreement follows extensive discussions between the parties as the previous contract is set to expire. “DStv customers will continue to enjoy around the clock news coverage from SABC News on channel 404, while SABC Encore on channel 156 will allow viewers to indulge in nostalgia, airing old favourites and classics,” the companies said in a joint statement. “The SABC archives, which the SABC uses to produce SABC Encore, remains the wholly-owned property of the SABC.” – African News Agency (ANA)
