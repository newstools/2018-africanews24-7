JOHANNESBURG, August 10 – Four people were arrested for attempting to rob a security vehicle transporting cash at a garage in Tzaneen in Limpopo province, police said. Police spokeswoman Colonel Brenda Muridili said the incident happened on Thursday. Police had been on the lookout in the area after receiving information about a possible cash-in-transit heist. ”Members noticed a white VW Polo TSI with Mpumalanga registration numbers scouting the place and discovered that the registration number was false.  There were also four suspicious men in the vicinity,” said Muridili. ”As members approached the Polo, the cash vehicle drove in. A shootout and a car chase ensued. Four suspects were apprehended, one of them with a gunshot wound.” The fifth suspect managed to flee the scene on foot. The Polo and a silver BMW were seized by the police. Police commissioner Lt General Khehla Sitole welcomed the police work. ”Cash robberies threaten the safety of our communities as the brazen criminals do not hesitate to shoot their way out when confronted with possible arrest,” Sitole said. “I have to commend the bravery of our members who did not back down during a shootout and managed to arrest these suspects before they could commit robbery. This is as the result of the police’s pursuance on stamping the authority of the state. We will continue to squeeze the space of criminals to zero,” he added. – African News Agency (ANA)
