JOHANNESBURG, August 6 (ANA) – More than 120 people have been left homeless after 50 shacks burnt down early Monday at Kathrada Park informal settlement in Claremont, Johannesburg. City emergency services spokesman Robert Mulaudzi said the fire was caused by an unattended burning candle in one of the shacks. ”We urge residents in informal settlements to look after all light and heating devices such as paraffin stoves and candles and not leave them unattended. Our disaster management team will be attending to the displaced residents.” No injuries were reported. – African News Agency (ANA)
