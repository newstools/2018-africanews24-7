ASABA, Nigeria, August 4  – Producing one of the most dominant displays at these championships so far, Caster Semenya sped to a 49.96sec victory in the 400m to highlight the third day of action at the African Athletics Championships on Friday in Asaba, Nigeria. After a relatively cautious first half, the world and Olympic champion at 800m left the field gasping over the second as she sped away towards the first sub-50-second performance of her career. “It’s always been a dream to go sub-50, I figured at the right time and with the right conditions in my favour, it would come,” said the South African, who arrived in Nigeria with a 50.40 lifetime best set in 2016. “This was one of those races that work in your favour.” Initially entered to chase the 800/1 500m double here, Semenya opted for the one and two-lap distances instead to work on her speed and rhythm for the 800m which remains her favourite distance and focus of the remainder of her season. “We’re using this more for preparation for the 800. We ran a heat and a semi on Friday, which was more like a training session for me. “Today was more of a one-off. I just had to focus on my start, maintain through the halfway and then see what I could produce in the last 150 metres, which I know I could do better there. I feel good, that’s the main thing. I can’t wait until the 800m on Saturday.” Christine Botlogetwe was a distant second in 51.19 with Ajayi Yinka of Nigeria clocking 51.34 for bronze. (ANA)
