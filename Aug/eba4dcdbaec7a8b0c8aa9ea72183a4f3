JOHANNESBURG, August 17 – Minister of Higher Education and Training Naledi Pandor has appointed SA Revenue Services (Sars) executive Randall Carollissen as an administrator at the embattled National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS). His appointment comes after the resignation of former board chairman Sizwe Nxasana who had headed the scheme for three years. ”Dr Carolissen is appointed to NSFAS as administrator for a period of one year to take over the governance, management and administration of the entity. The appointment will be effective from the date of the publication of a notice in the Government Gazette, which will be done early next week,” the Department of Higher Education and Training said on Friday. Carollissen is group executive of revenue planning, analysis and reporting at the revenue collector. Nxasana’s resignation came as the embattled scheme faced funding backlogs for students that led to protests at institutions. The NSFAS resorted to halting 2019 funding applications in an effort to deal with outstanding payments for the thousands that were promised free higher education in December 2017. There had been increasing calls for Nxasana to resign, with the Cosatu affiliated National Health and Allied Workers Union (Nehawu) accusing him of mismanaging the funding scheme and nepotism. The union demanded that CEO Steven Zwane also follow suit and step down or face ”being pushed out’.’ Nxasana said the sudden December announcement of free higher education for poor students by former president Jacob Zuma led to funding obligations increasing rapidly and placing ”extreme strain” on NSFAS systems and processes. – African News Agency (ANA)
