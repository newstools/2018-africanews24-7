JOHANNESBURG, August 22 – Kaizer Chiefs on Wednesday announced the signing of Lebogang Manyama on a three-year deal. Chiefs later announced the signing of defender Mario Booysen from Ajax Cape Town on a two-year deal. Manyama played last season for Turkish side Konyaspor. The attacking midfielder had a strong 2016/2017 season with Cape Town City, being selected as the PSL Footballer of the Season and also winning the Golden Boot with 13 goals. Manyama was instrumental in helping Cape Town City win the 2016 Telkom Knockout. The 27-year-old also played for Mpumalanga Black Aces, SuperSport United and Ajax Cape Town. The midfielder will bolster Chiefs’ attacking options. “It’s a dream come true,” said Manyama. “I have supported Chiefs from a young age. I grew up on the same street as Brian Baloyi in Alexandra and that’s how I fell in love with the club. “I now want to help the club win trophies and to achieve glory, because that’s what the Kaizer Chiefs brand represents to me.” Booysen appeared last season in 27 league matches for Ajax Cape Town. He has in total participated in more than 180 Absa Premiership games and therefore arrives at Kaizer Chiefs with an abundance of experience. “If you set yourself goals,” clearly excited Booysen comments, “you aim for the best and Chiefs are just that. It’s been a lifelong aspiration to play for this club as I have always felt that Kaizer Chiefs are far ahead of all other South African clubs. They are true leaders, all others follow.” (ANA)
