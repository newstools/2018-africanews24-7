CAPE TOWN, August 14 – President Cyril Ramaphosa on Tuesday announced the appointment of Silas Ramaite as South Africa’s acting prosecutions boss following Monday’s Constitutional Court judgment which found Shaun Abrahams’ appointment to the post invalid. “While the President is studying the judgment, he is committed to appointing a permanent NDPP [national director of public prosecutions] well within the 90 days given by the Constitutional Court for such an appointment to be made,” the presidency said in a statement. “In the interim, President Ramaphosa has appointed Dr Ramaite as Acting National Director of Public Prosecutions.” Ramaite has been deputy national director of public prosecutions since 2003. His responsibilities include administration and running the Office for Witness Protection. The advocate had a short stint as acting NDPP in 2015 following the departure of Mxolisi Nxasana before Abrahams was appointed by Ramaphosa’s predecessor, Jacob Zuma. The Constitutional Court on Monday upheld a high court finding that Abrahams’ appointment was invalid, and an order that Nxasana pay back a R17.3 million golden handshake. Ramaite holds the degrees B.Proc (University of Fort Hare), LL.B; LL.M, specialising in Criminal Law, Constitutional Law, Administrative Law and Public International Law and LL.D, specialising in Constitutional Law (University of South Africa). He was admitted as an advocate of the Supreme Court in 1988 and was granted the status of Senior Counsel (SC) in 2001. (ANA)
