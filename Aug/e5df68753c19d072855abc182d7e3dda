Solly Makganoto A cosy picture of DJ Zinhle and baby daddy, AKA,  has caused a sensation on social media. DJ Zinhle started trending soon after the picture started circulating on Twitter with tweeps wondering if the pair have gotten back together. Although AKA has publicly admitted that he is still “in love” with DJ Zinhle, neither of them has confirmed if they are dating again. Zinhle has previously told Real Talk they’ve decided to get along for Kairo’s sake. Only time will tell if the pair will publicly admit if they are indeed dating or nah.
