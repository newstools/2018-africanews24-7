Kenyan world and Commonwealth Games champion Hellen Obiri also claimed African gold, winning the women’s 5,000m. Simbine won his race into a headwind in 10.25 seconds. “For me, it is marvelous,” he said. “I know for now I am going to represent Africa in the Continental Cup so this made me want to work harder and train more. It is a great feat.” Winners at the championships earn berths on the African team in the Continental Cup which matches teams from Africa, Asia, Europe, Oceania, the Americas, South America and the United States on Sept. 8-9 in Ostrava, Czech Republic.

Second place went to Ghana’s Janet Amponsah (11.54) with Joy Udo-Gabriel of Nigeria third (11.58).
