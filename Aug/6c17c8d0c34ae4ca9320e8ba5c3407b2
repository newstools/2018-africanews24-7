JOHANNESBURG, August 16 – A building is on fire in Rissik Street, downtown Johannesburg, as the fire department, police and emergency medical rescue services try to put it out and rescue its occupants. Four fire engines and several police vehicles have responded to the fire. EMS spokeswoman Nana Radebe told African News Agency (ANA) the fire was under control. “For now, we do not have any injuries reported as yet, but we have people trapped on top of the building and we are still trying to rescue them.” Rissik Street, a major street passing in front of Johannesburg Park Station, has been closed off to traffic at Plein Street up to Braamfontein. The fire appeared to be blazing on the first floor while the building is engulfed by a thick cloud of black smoke. The building is used by homeless people while a variety of smallholding shops occupy the ground floor. Police on the scene have declined to speak with the media, pushing onlookers as far away as possible. The cause of the fire remains unknown at this stage. – African News Agency (ANA)
