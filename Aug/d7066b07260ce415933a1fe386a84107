Staff Reporter US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo has been requested to “closely study” South Africa’s land reform by President Donald Trump, this was confirmed via a tweet on the US president’s social media account. President Donald Trump’s tweet seems to have been stimulated by an “exclusive investigation” on Fox News about farm seizures in South Africa. I have asked Secretary of State @SecPompeo to closely study the South Africa land and farm seizures and expropriations and the large scale killing of farmers. “South African Government is now seizing land from white farmers.” @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 23, 2018  “The president of South Africa, President Cyril Ramaphosa has begun seizing land from his own citizens without compensation because they are the wrong skin colour. That is literally the definition of racism,” journalist Tucker Carlson started the broadcast by saying, going on to label the South African government ‘racist’ and land expropriation ‘immoral’. The government hit back and dismissed the “narrow perception which only seeks to divide our nation”. “South Africa has taken bold steps to address the colonial and historical injustices, including the dispossession of land and build a more inclusive and stable society in South Africa and the world. “Government supports land restitution and redistribution, which will redress the sins of the past by allowing access to the land in a way that grows the economy, ensures food security, and increases agricultural production.” South Africa totally rejects this narrow perception which only seeks to divide our nation and reminds us of our colonial past. #landexpropriation @realDonaldTrump @PresidencyZA — South African Government (@GovernmentZA) August 23, 2018  South Africa will speed up the pace of land reform in a careful and inclusive manner that does not divide our nation. #landexpropriation @realDonaldTrump @PresidencyZA — South African Government (@GovernmentZA) August 23, 2018   SA belong to South Africans and Africans not you #DonaldTrump, what we do with our country is none of yr problem so buddy stay away from our domestic issues @realDonaldTrump. White people disrespected us from ages ago this our land #LandExpropriation — Basiami Moyakhe (@McCoozy_AKin) August 23, 2018   Donald Trump and Fox News are two examples of how seriously moronic the ‘civilized’ West is. I guess @afriforum knew they had counterparts in them. News Flash: #LandExpropriation WILL happen without hindrance. It is the will of the people. Salute — Vezuchiy Fanashnikov (@fanamokoena) August 23, 2018   #LandExpropriation white minority and also beneficiaries of apartheid have no right to cry about this issue. Vast amount of land was taken illegally from black majority South Africans without compensation and now we are taking it back. — 25 Aug baby (@candylux752) August 23, 2018  CyrilRamaphosa should phone that small minded destructive imperialist directly and should not go down the level of his representative in SA. Rand sinks after Trump land reform tweet https://t.co/ZNDlrmL6tZ via @ewnreporter — Zwelinzima Vavi (@Zwelinzima1) August 23, 2018  Yet another imperialist intervention to stop South Africa from addressing the legacy of imperialism and colonialism from the usual suspect #USAPresident @DonaldTrumpAsia — Zwelinzima Vavi (@Zwelinzima1) August 23, 2018  That’s madness and highest form of foolishness by a racist bigot, who lacks the basic intelligence to understand anything. South Africa will never be intimidated by global racists who believe in lies. Land expropriation will happen against all forms of threats by Foolishness. https://t.co/29mGJChr98 — Floyd Shivambu (@FloydShivambu) August 23, 2018  Naming and shaming racists won’t get us the land back… The master racists @afriforum are spreading lies about Black People faster than we can put our pants on. #BlackTwitter worldwide, get the strap GIVE TRUMP THE TRUTH!!! #LandExpropriation ???? https://t.co/wlbfEz2Pyz — ? #K1? #3DaySpringBreak Germiston Lake!
