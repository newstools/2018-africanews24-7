JOHANNESBURG, August 21 – The Vrede Dairy fraud matter will not be struck off the roll after the Bloemfontein Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday decided to postpone the matter to allow for further investigation. Magistrate Collin Nenkosi ruled on Tuesday that the state must finalise its investigations and provide the accused with the finalised docket by the end of November 2018. The state alleges that the eight suspects conspired to syphon off R220m to the Gupta family from the Free State Agriculture Department in what the Asset Forfeiture Unit has said was a “scheme designed to defraud and steal monies from the department”. It is also alleged that 100 emerging farmers who were meant to benefit from the Vrede Dairy Farm project were left high and dry. The accused, who are all out on bail ranging from R100,000 to R200,000, include the head of department in the Free State Agricultural Department Mbana Peter Thabethe, chief financial officer Sylvia Seipate Dlamini, former general manager District Services in the department Dr Takisi Janki Masiteng, former Oakbay CEO Ashu Chawla, former Oakbay director Nazeem Howa, another former Oakbay director Varun Gupta and Tegeta Resources director Ronica Ragavan and Kamal Vasram. The accused, who face a host of charges including corruption, theft, fraud, conspiracy to commit fraud and contravening the Public Finance Management, have had their bail extended and conditions relaxed. They are now only expected to report to the police once a month until their next court appearance on 4 December. They only have to report international travel plans to the investigating officer. – African News Agency (ANA)
