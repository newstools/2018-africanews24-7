HARARE – European Union observers on Wednesday said Zimbabwe’s elections had several problems, including media bias, voter intimidation and mistrust in the electoral commission and questioned delays in releasing the presidential results. The vote assessment by the EU, which is observing the results for the first time since 2002, is critical in determining whether Zimbabwe can shed its pariah status and return into the international fold, which could help trigger an economic revival.  -(Reuters)
