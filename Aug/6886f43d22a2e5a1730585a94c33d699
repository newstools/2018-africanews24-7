JOHANNESBURG, August 7 – Kaizer Chiefs coach Giovanni Solinas says they will keep to their philosophy and play ‘our football’ in Tuesday night’s match against Bidvest Wits at the FNB Stadium (start 7.30pm). “Wits have a competitive side with a fighting spirit,” said Solinas. “They are a typical Gavin Hunt-coached team, having some good players who play with determination. “The match against Wits will be no different. It’s going to be a tough one for both sides. We won’t change much, as we always play our football and keep to our philosophy.” The coach took notice of Wits’ 3-0 thumping of Free State Stars in their opening fixture. Chiefs played to a draw in an epic battle away against Mamelodi Sundowns on Saturday. “We come from a tough match,” continued Solinas. The Italian reported no injury worries from the Sundowns trip. “We will exploit their weaknesses. I am extremely happy to see my players putting so much effort into training.” It will be the first home match for Solinas and new signing Khama Billiat, who won Man-of-the-Match award for his excellent performance against the Brazilians. The coach didn’t give away much in terms of maintaining the same line-up as compared to the Sundown match. “We will field the best team to play on the day,” he concluded. – African News Agency (ANA)
