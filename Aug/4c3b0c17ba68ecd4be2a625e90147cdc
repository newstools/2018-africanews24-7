DURBAN, August 19 – Aphiwe Dyantyi, who was named Man of the Match in the Boks’ Rugby Championship opener, has highlighted his desire to always put the team first. The Boks kicked off their Rugby Championship campaign in solid fashion as they manufactured a 34-21 bonus-point victory over Argentina in Durban on Saturday. Dyantyi was one of the clear standout performers, with the talented 23-year-old scoring a brace of tries, while making a meaningful impact almost every time he was involved in play. It was another fine performance from the young winger, who just a few short years ago had remarkably opted to give up the game. Yet, he eventually decided to give it one more go, and his rise to stardom since then has been quite remarkable. Although Dyantyi deservedly earned plenty of plaudits on Saturday, he also left some fans perplexed when he turned down a clear-cut try-scoring opportunity to rather put fellow winger Makazole Mapimpi away for a try. It was a decision that denied Dyantyi a hat-trick of tries, but he explained that it wasn’t even a conscious decision. “I just felt he was in a better position to score, so I gave him the ball to score,” he affirmed when chatting to media after the game. “For me, the most important thing is getting the result. It doesn’t help if I score 50 tries and we lose all of those games. If I can score two tries in 20 games and we win all of those games, that’s more important for me than becoming the top try scorer.” Dyantyi certainly looks to have all the raw ingredients to enjoy a long and illustrious career in the green and gold, and he said the Bok camp certainly provided the sort of environment for a youngster to reach their potential. “I think with the senior guys around me, they keep motivating me to keep improving,” he said. “I think the guys are gelling really well, considering that we’ve only played three games under coach Rassie (Erasmus). I think every day we just keep on building.” (ANA)
