RUSTENBURG, August 1 – North West Premier Job Mokgoro arrived in Rustenburg on Wednesday, where he will speak to public servants in the Bojanala district as part of his ongoing engagements with key government stakeholders. His engagements will be extended to provincial government officials and those based in district offices. The packed hall at the Rustenburg Civic Centre stood up and women ululated when Mokgoro arrived accompanied by his special political adviser Pitso Tolo, Education and Sports Development member of the executive committee (MEC) Sello Leheri and Rustenburg Mayor Mpho Khunou. He is expected to address officials on issues of good governance and the significance of putting people first, and will also afford officials the opportunity to highlight areas affecting the delivery of services. The South African National Civic Organisation (Sanco) in the North West praised Mokgoro for resisting political interference in the provincial administration and affairs of municipalities. This followed the Provincial Executive Council’s decision to differ with the African National Congress (ANC) provincial executive committee on placing seven municipalities under administration. “The tough stance that the premier has adopted on critical issues has sent an unequivocal message that he is not a pushover or a lackey but an independent leader who will not seek political approval while compromising on his mandate to restore good governance and rid the provincial administration of maladministration and corruption,” provincial chairperson Paul Sebegoe said on Tuesday. – African News Agency (ANA)
