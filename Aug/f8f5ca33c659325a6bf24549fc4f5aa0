CAPE TOWN, August 17 – South Africa’s public broadcaster (SABC) has appointed a new spokesperson after the appointment of Neo Momodu as group executive for corporate affairs and marketing, the state-owned company said in a statement. In a statement, the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) said: “In her new role at the SABC, Ms Momodu will work with the executive management team in the positioning of the SABC as an authentic and world-class public service broadcaster to fulfil its mandate of acting continuously for the betterment of our society.” Momodu holds an undergraduate degree in law from the University of Hertfordshire and a post-graduate diploma at the Wits Business School.

We are confident that she is equipped to lead this critical division of the organisation. The Board and management of the SABC, wish Ms Momodu well in executing her duties,” said Mxakwe. – African News Agency (ANA)
