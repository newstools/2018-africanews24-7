JOHANNESBURG, August 21 – The National Press Club said on Tuesday that it was concerning to see continued job losses in the South African media industry at a time when it was already under pressure after TV news channel, Afro Worldview, went off air on DStv channel 405 as its contract with pay TV operator MultiChoice came to an end. Multichoice on Tuesday pulled the plug on Afro Worldview – the television channel formerly owned by the Gupta brothers under the name ANN7 – which until Monday night had been aired on DSTV 405. Staff at the broadcaster were informed not to report for work from Tuesday. Chairman of the National Press Club, Jos Charle, said they wished all employees of Afro Worldview well and trusted that they would obtain employment and continue to practice the trade they love as soon as possible. “We can only hope that our colleagues would soon be engaged by other media enterprises so they can continue to earn a living for their families and contribute their much-needed skills to the challenge to tell the South African story,” Charle said. The channel’s closure comes a few months after Afro Voice newspaper, formerly known as The New Age, was shut down. According to news reports, MultiChoice concluded its bidding process for a new 24-hour broadcaster in July. (ANA)
