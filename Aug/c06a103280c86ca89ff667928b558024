JOHANNESBURG, August 1 – The popular annual Soweto Wine Festival plans to take the 100 percent black-owned festival overseas to share South African wines with the rest of the world. Majority shareholder Saki Zamxaka said his personal passion for wines helped pique his interest in the festival. “I’ve been collecting South African wines for over 15 years and the idea of introducing these wines to an even broader audience is incredibly appealing. I’ve purchased the Soweto Wine Festival because I think there is immense potential to build the wine industry, both here in South Africa and abroad,” Zamxaka said. “In the future, I envision the Soweto Wine Festival as a world-class festival that encapsulates not just South African wine, but truly represents South Africa and can introduce the world more deeply to us.” The 13th annual Soweto Wine Festival is set to return to Walter Sisulu Square in Kliptown, Soweto, on the 1st and 2nd September 2018, to showcase the best of South Africa’s wines, cuisine, travel destinations and lifestyle brands, to the thousands of wine lovers that the festival attracts every year. Walter Sisulu Square was chosen in celebration of #Mandela100, as he would have turned 100 years old this year, and it is the iconic venue where the Freedom Charter was signed on 26 June 1955. – African News Agency (ANA)
