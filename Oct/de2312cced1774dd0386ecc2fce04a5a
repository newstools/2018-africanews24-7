PRETORIA, October 24 – Finance minister Tito Mboweni on Wednesday described the Giyani Water project as a “cesspool of corruption”, saying that it was plagued by malfeasance. Last week reports emerged how the Giyani Water Project was lying idle despite R3.5 billion being spent by the government over a six-year period. The challenges facing the project range from a complete disregard for supply chain rules to poor contract management, resulting in irregular expenditure. Mboweni said a key element of the new approach will be a stronger focus on project management and contract governance to ensure that projects, such as the Giyani Water Project, were fit for purpose and maximise value for money in the water sector. “The Giyani Water Project is plagued by malfeasance. It is a cesspool of corruption. It is clear that a new delivery and financing model is required to provide water services to communities,” Mboweni said. “I have asked the director-general of the National Treasury to work with the Department of Water and Sanitation to ensure that appropriate action is taken against all guilty officials implicated in the Auditor-General’s report. The President has informed me that he will go to Giyani to see exactly what has happened and what needs to be done.” Mboweni announced that local government equitable share, which finances free basic services to low-income households such as access to water, sanitation, electricity and shelter for poor households, and some administrative costs for municipalities, was expected to grow by 9.4 percent per year to R82.2 billion by 2021/22. Over the medium-term expenditure framework period, R415.5 billion will be transferred to local government, including R146.3 billion in infrastructure conditional grants. – African News Agency (ANA)
