PRETORIA, October 8 – Former Gauteng Hawks head General Shadrack Sibiya on Monday said he was disappointed that the National Prosecuting Authority provisionally withdrew charges against him relating to his alleged involvement in the 2010 illegal rendition of several Zimbabwean nationals. “There is no evidence to proceed against us and I don’t know why it has been provisionally withdrawn,” he said. Speaking to journalists on Monday after the court order, Sibiya said he would have been happy if the NPA had instituted a stay of prosecution,. He appeared frustrated with how the case had been handled and said he lost his job over this matter and still owes lawyers money. “I’m still saying now, there is no evidence against myself and general Dramat, there is no case, they are sitting with false evidence which is in the docket….I’m telling you now, the State wont proceed against myself and general Dramat,” said Sibiya. Sibiya, who is now the head of the anti-corruption unit in the City of Johannesburg, was charged along with former national Hawks head Anwa Dramat and former police investigator Lieutenant-Colonel Lesley Maluleke. Maluleke still remains charged and is due to appear again on 12 November. The trio were were charged in 2016. They were accused of unlawfully handing over Zimbabwean fugitives to police from that country in 2010. Independent Police Investigative Directorate spokesperson Moses Dlamini said the NPA’s decision confirm the recommendations they made in 2015 and they should have never proceeded with charges against Sibiya and Dramat.
