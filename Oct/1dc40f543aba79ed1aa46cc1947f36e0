Umkhonto we Sizwe Military Veterans’ Association spokesperson, Carl Niehaus has requested the African National Congress (ANC) to withdraw their statement, in which the party expressed their condolences at the passing of former minister Pik Botha who died in Pretoria, aged 86, on Thursday night. The ANC said in a statement: “He was amongst apartheid-era leaders who led mindset change amongst proponents of apartheid to accept the inevitability of change and played part in the transition to the new South Africa.” Niehaus said in his Facebook post that the statement was grossly insensitive to the many victims of apartheid, more especially to MK liberation soldier; Comrade Eric Mtshali who died in Durban on Friday, aged 84. “For years the likes of Botha hunted comrade Mtshali down, killed many of his fellow MK comrades, and wanted to kill him too.” Here is Carl Niehaus’s full Facebook post: My dear fellow comrades in the African National Congress, a heartfelt comradely request: Yesterday two prominent people died: – The one an MK liberation soldier and icon of our struggle – Comrade #EricMtshali; – The second a racist apartheid thug and killer #PikBotha; For years the likes of Botha hunted comrade Mtshali down, killed many of his fellow MK comrades, and wanted to kill him too. Really it was totally wrong for the ANC to have issued a statement mourning the death of a racist apartheid thug such as #PikBotha! You may have meant it as an act of reconciliation, but it is not. Instead it was grossly insensitive to the many victims of apartheid, made worse by issuing it on the day that a great liberation soldier – and impeccable enemy of thugs like Botha – passed away. Please withdraw that statement immediately!
