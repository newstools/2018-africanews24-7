There is nothing more like an eye-catching store experience where you want customers to see, smell and grab your luxury boutique designs. For this reason, Royal Blush opened its first boutique store at Sandton eatery, Rivonia on Deck. Staff Reporter JOHANNESBURG- Natacia McKenzie’s love for travelling has spawned a business idea — she has decided to bring the glamorous clothes and accessories spotted during trips abroad for resale back home, giving local women access to the latest global fashion they might otherwise only see in magazines. McKenzie, who launched her much-anticipated Boutique on Friday night, has set up Royal Blush boutique with the aim of bringing global fashion home. The launch of Royal Blush boutique is set to elevate the standards of the fashion industry. Prior to the launch of her Boutique, McKenzie ran with a simple, but effective operating system where she would post pictures of the clothes and accessories she believed would appeal to South African women on Instagram (@royalblush_01) and she still accepts orders via the platform. Amongst those who attended the launch was businessman Kenny Kunene, who said that he took it upon himself to nurture and encourage McKenzie’s love and passion for fashion. “It’s really amazing what this young lady has achieved. I’ve had the opportunity of viewing some of her designs and believe me, they are amazing and mind-blowing”, Kunene said. According to McKenzie, Royal Blush is filled with designs that of which, everyone can afford. Thanking those that attended the launch, McKenzie said that the Boutique would have not come to being had it not been of her uncle, Gayton McKenzie’s support, who pushed her all the way to achieving what she described as “God’s grace”. McKenzie’s big coup was when a popular South African actress and television personality Nonhle Thema wore an outfit from Royal Blush during an appearance on the local Trending SA TV programme.
