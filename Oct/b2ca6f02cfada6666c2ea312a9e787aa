PRETORIA, October 6 – The Springboks were left to rue a squandered opportunity for a rare second successive win over the All Blacks with a 32-30 defeat at Loftus Versfeld in Pretoria on Sunday. The Kiwis led just once – after the final kick of the game by Richie Mo’unga – to claim another win over South Africa despite trailing by 17 points with 10 minutes to play. Both captain Siya Kolisi and Man of the Match Malcolm Marx agreed that the Boks let a massive chance to beat the All Blacks slip through their fingers in the closing stages. “We let it go at the end. We knew it was going to be tough but I think at the end, they were more alert than us and that was the difference,” said Kolisi. The Springbok flanker was still able to take some positives away from the clash even with the bitter taste of defeat set to kick in later. “It was a good game and I’m proud of the boys,” he added. “Our game management was much better, much better than last week. We didn’t need those soft moments especially not in a game like this. We will learn from this and go back and see where we can improve. I’m still proud of the performance and the way the team is growing, even if we didn’t get the right result.” Marx, withdrawn for Bongi Mbonambi with eight minutes to play, echoed his skipper’s thoughts . “I think we threw it away,” said Marx. “You know, it was one or two soft moments at the end and we kind of did it ourselves. The result didn’t go our way but we still have four more games at the end of the year and we’ll be looking to end off on a high.” (ANA)
