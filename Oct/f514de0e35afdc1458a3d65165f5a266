JOHANNESBURG, October 1 – Despite back-to-back Rugby Championship wins, South Africa remained in fifth place in the latest World Rugby rankings released on Monday. South Africa’s failure to land a try-bonus point in a 23-12 win over Australia in Port Elizabeth meant New Zealand only had to win in Buenos Aires to retain the Rugby Championship trophy with a round to spare. The Springboks are assured of second place in the Rugby Championship table though, ahead of next Saturday’s meeting with the All Blacks in Pretoria, after overturning their recent run of poor form against the Wallabies. South Africa gained a fraction over six-tenths of a rating point for the win and held their position in the rankings, while Australia stay seventh, still 2.74 points better off than France. There were no other matches involving African teams over the weekend, and as a result, there are no changes in the African rankings. Namibia is Africa’s second-ranked side at number 22 in the world. Kenya are the third-ranked African nation in 28th place on the global ratings. Top-10 African rugby rankings:
