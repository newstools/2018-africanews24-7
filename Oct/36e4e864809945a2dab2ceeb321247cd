by Hloni Mashigo Pan African Congress (PAC) president and union leader Narius Moloto is not guilty of sexual harassment, this according to the South African Police Services. The Hillbrow Police have confirmed that there seems to be a plot of extortion against Moloto. This follows a complaint by a 23-year-old woman claiming Moloto demanded sexual favours in exchange for a promotion. Moloto’s attorneys have since presented cellphone messages from the woman to Moloto’s number threatening to “tell the world” about Moloto if he didn’t pay her 100 000 thousand rands in cash. The sender whose number is registered to someone last named “Pitsi” first demanded that Moloto purchase a vehicle for her. In a Whatsapp message on February 14, the woman told Moloto that she wished for a mature man to take care of her. On Sunday the former University of Pretoria student went to the media to label Moloto a sex pest. According to police, when Pitsi was contacted on allegations of extortion, she responded that “she was simply playing and intended no harm to Moloto”. Detective Thomas Matukane has confirmed that a case of extortion has been opened against Pitsi at the Hillbrow police station. Moloto was not available for comment but his lawyers, Werksman Attorneys said: “Mr Moloto is a family man and a politician. It’s has hurt his family and his party members. We believe he has the grounds for a strong civil case.”
