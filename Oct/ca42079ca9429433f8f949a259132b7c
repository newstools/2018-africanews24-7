PRETORIA, October 26 – The Blue Bulls Company on Friday confirmed the signing of Springbok No 8 Duane Vermeulen. The big ball carrying loose, who is currently plying his trade in Japan, will arrive in Pretoria in February 2019 and will spend the duration of the season with the Vodacom Bulls. Vermeulen has donned the Green and Gold of the Springboks on 42 occasions and boasts an illustrious career with a number of top-class teams including Pumas, Toyota Cheetahs, DHL Stormers, Toulon and the Kubota Spears. BBCO High-Performance Manager, Xander Janse van Rensburg, expressed his excitement on the acquisition: “Duane is an amazing rugby player, and is well respected around the world. “We firmly believe that his abrasive style of play and experience will add immense value to our Vodacom Super Rugby campaign next year. At the age of 32, he is a seasoned veteran, that just gets better with every season.” Vermeulen is also a strong crowd favourite among all South Africans, and he will no doubt be welcomed with open arms by the Loftus faithful. “2019 is going to be a massive year for us,” said Vermeulen, “and I’m keen on starting it with an impact at Loftus. The Bulls have always been a team that I have respected and I’m looking forward to joining the family.“ – African News Agency (ANA)
