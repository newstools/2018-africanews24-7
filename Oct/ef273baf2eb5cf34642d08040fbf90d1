DURBAN, October  – Kaizer Chiefs will serve their punishment on Saturday at Durban’s Moses Mabhida Stadium when they have to play a home Premiership fixture against Polokwane City behind closed doors (start at 6pm). The lockout is as a result of the order imposed by the Disciplinary Committee of the PSL. This followed the events of April 21 at Moses Mabhida Stadium after the Nedbank Cup match against Free State Stars where fans invaded the pitch and caused damage to property. In the order, Chiefs were found guilty and ordered to play three league matches in KwaZulu-Natal without spectators. The playing of one match behind closed doors shall be suspended for a period of 24 months, provided that Chiefs are not found guilty of a similar offence. The club has since appealed the decision. However, in terms of rule 24.3 of the Rules of the League, as contained in the League’s Handbook, “an appeal against an order of the Disciplinary Committee or the Dispute Resolution Chamber will not suspend the operation of that order pending the finalisation of any appeal or arbitration in respect of that order.” Therefore, despite the club’s above mentioned appeal, the order of the Disciplinary Committee in this matter remains in operation pending the outcome of the appeal or any arbitration process that may follow the appeal.” Supporters need to take note that there will be no tickets sold for the match. The game is scheduled to be broadcast live on SuperSport 4. (ANA)
