Staff Reporter JOHANNESBURG – Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba has apologised for a video containing material of a sexual nature meant to be only seen by him and his wife, which has been circulating among certain political figures. Gigaba says the video is at the centre of a number of blackmail and extortion attempts, dating back to the period immediately following his appointment as finance minister in March last year. Gigaba took time on Sunday morning to clarify the incident on Twitter and said that the footage was stolen from his phone after it was illegally intercepted or hacked in 2016/17. “These blackmail/extortion attempts as well as the illegal interception of my communication/hacking of my phone have all been reported to the relevant law enforcement/intelligence agencies and I am advised that the resultant investigations are still continuing,” Gigaba tweeted. “I take this opportunity to publicly apologise, in advance, to the rest of my family – especially my kids, my mom and my in-laws – and the South African public for the pain and embarrassment the likely wider distribution of this private material will cause “I hope our nation will, someday, constructively engage with the question of whether it is correct to condone and promote the gross invasion of the privacy of others by distributing such material, more especially in the clear absence of a public interest justification.”
