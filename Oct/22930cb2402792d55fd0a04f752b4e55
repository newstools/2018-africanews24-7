JOHANNESBURG, October 29 – Leader of Black First Land First (BLF) will on Monday launch a crowd-funding platform to raise R605,000 required as a deposit by the Independent Electoral Commission of SA (IEC) for the upcoming 2019 general elections. ”BLF will be appealing to the public for donations to pay the required amount which in terms of legislation is refundable once representation in parliament is won by a political party. BLF intends to donate the entire amount, upon it being refunded by the IEC, to worthy social upliftment projects. To this end two projects have been identified namely, upgrading a school; and building a house for a deserving family,” the party said in a statement. BLF leader Andile Mngxitama is scheduled to launch the crowd-funding campaign at a primary school in KwaZulu-Natal. The campaign on crowd-funding platform www.backabuddy.co.za had raised R277 by lunchtime on Monday. Mngxitama, a former Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) MP, formed BLF after he was expelled by the red berets. The EFF expelled Mngxitama, Mpho Ramakatsa and Khanyisile Litchfield-Tshabalala after they were found guilty by a disciplinary committee on various charges. They had alleged corruption and mismanagement of party funds against EFF leaders. – African News Agency (ANA)
