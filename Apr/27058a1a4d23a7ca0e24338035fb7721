JOHANNESBURG, April 12 – Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi said on Thursday online applications for 2019 grade one and eight learners will open on Monday 16 April and that foreign learners were allowed to apply for school places in the province. “We have modernised this system, it will take parents less than five minutes,”. “There will be a drop button that will ask for their country of origin and it will pick up the relevant documentation,” explained Lesufi. “Anyone who doesn’t have data must go to their nearest community library.” The Education MEC said parents now had the option to choose which school they wanted their child to attend and wouldn’t be forced to select certain schools based on their demographics and language. According to MEC Lesufi, education department system has been linked to the Home Affairs Department which would make it easy for learners to receive study permits faster. “Our system can handle 35,000 parents per second, so no parents will say the system is hanging.” Lesufi said parents of grade R learners should not assume that their children will be migrated immediately. He said they have to apply online. “You will now be able to select if you want a boarding school, all boys or all girls school.” He urged parents to apply on time so that the department can prepare adequately. He said parents, who wanted to physically apply could also go to their nearest district offices, where they would be assisted. Alternatively, they can call the GDE call centre. – African News Agency (ANA)
