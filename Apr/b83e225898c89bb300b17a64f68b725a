Baboloki Thebe, 21, made it a Botswana double podium finish with second place in 45.09, with Jamaica’s Javon Francis taking bronze in a season’s best of 45.11. The eighth-fastest man in history finally delivered on his immense talent with his first gold medal at a major championship. The 31-year-old Makwala began well and had already taken the lead at the 200m mark, before surging away from the field in the latter part of the race to complete a dominant display. – African News Agency (ANA)
