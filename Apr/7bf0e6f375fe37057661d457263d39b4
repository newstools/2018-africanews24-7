Sello Theletsane JOHANNESBURG- As thousands have packed Orlando Stadium to pay tribute to struggle icon Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, those who couldn’t make it are celebrating her life in their own way. A group of women from Enterprise Development Solutions Projects paid homage to Madikizela-Mandela at their workplace and social media to share what she meant to them. They said they felt today was an important day to honour a great icon. They added that as women, they felt empowered by the strength and courage Mamma Winnie had and today they honour a true female legend “Mama Winnie Mandela will always be an inspiration. She is a woman of strength, a South African freedom fighter, the Mother of the nation and the pillar of hope for many young South African women. That’s why I saluted her,” said Jenell Le Roux. Tracey-Lee Taylor said Madikizela-Mandela would be remembered for her fierceness, courage and confidence that kept the struggle against apartheid alive. “She will forever be thought of as the “Mother of our Nation”. She sacrificed her life for the freedom of her people,” said Talyor. Sonto Thabethe said she was inspired by Madikizela-Mandela’s courage, something that will be missed without her on earth. “Winnie Mandela was an inspiration to us women we will miss her and continue her fighting spiriting. May her soul rest in peace. She was a powerful and brave woman who stood up for the nation,” she said. Dude Radebe said Madikizela-Mandela fought and stood for women across the continent and particularly in South Africa. “She stood for all women, she did indeed embrace us all, she took everything was thrown to her days and nights. She is the reason we as women stand up and believed in our-self. You are truly insperational and we will always love u. Lala mama wesizwe,” she said. @SelloTheletsane
