NGCOBO, April 6 (ANA) – Around 25 people, who were evacuated from the Mancoba Seven Angels Church in Ngcobo, are still kept at social development care facilities in the Chris Hani district, the Eastern Cape department of social development said on Thursday. “This was a bloodbath debacle, from the shooting of police officers at the (Ngcobo Police) Station to the shooting of seven suspects at that church,” social worker, Nikiwe Makeleni — who had been supervising a project to deal with the aftermath of the shooting of five police officers and the events that lead to the police shooting seven people at a raid at the church — said. “My staff and I were among the first to arrive in both scenes. There was blood all over the place and what was even worse there at Mancoba place was that six dead bodies were lying on the floor outside, the seventh body was still inside. We looked for children the most and we found them in different shacks.” She was speaking at a function to honour the social workers for their contribution in dealing with the crisis. Police officers were killed during a robbery at the Ngcobo Police Station on February 21. On February 23, the police killed seven suspects during a shootout after they cornered the suspects at Seven Angels Church in the Nyanga Village. At least 18 suspects have been arrested following the incident. Six of them are facing charges that are raging from murder; attempted murder; and robbery with aggravating circumstances, while 12 are facing charges of conspiracy to commit robbery with aggravating circumstances; and robbery. Newly appointed Eastern Cape department of social development head, Ntombi Baart, said it was important to honour social workers for their role. “We are here to say your deeds didn’t go unnoticed. I can imagine the scars that are invisible to all of you,” Baart said. All the social workers who were part of Ngcobo crisis team were awarded certificates of recognition.
