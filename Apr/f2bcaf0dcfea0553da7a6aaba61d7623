JOHANNESBURG, April 6 (ANA) – South Africa’s first and much anticipated western, “Five Fingers for Marseilles”, is set to hit the big screens nationwide on Friday, production company Be Phat Motel said. The fast-paced action film will also be released in the US on September 7, starting in New York and Los Angeles, before moving to an additional 15 American cities. “We are thrilled to be working with the team that produced the Oscar winning films ‘Precious’ and ‘The Paperboy’ starring Zac Efron, Matthew McConaughey, Nicole Kidman, David Oyelowo. This is excellent news as it gives the film, which has fairly universal ideas and themes, access to a global cinema audience.” said writer-producer Sean Drummond.
