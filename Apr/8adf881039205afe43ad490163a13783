Zodidi Mhlana Four people including three children were killed during a shack fire that occurred in the early hours of Friday morning in Alexandra, Johannesburg. The City of Johannesburg emergency management services spokesperson, Robert Mulaudzi said that the victims aged five, seven, 13 and twenty-nine years old were burnt beyond recognition. Six other families were left homeless when their shacks caught fire. “The cause of the fire incident is still a subject of investigation at this stage, no further injuries were reported during the fire incident, six other shacks were completely destroyed during the fire incident,” Mulaudzi said. Mulaudzi said that at least six people have lost their lives in fires in recent weeks in Johannesburg. Two young boys died in a shack fire in Roodepoort Princes informal settlement two weeks ago. The boys were left alone by their parents who had visited a local tavern. “We would like to urge our residents throughout the City of Johannesburg especially our residents in our informal settlements to look after all their heating devices not to leave them unattended so that we can prevent devastating fire incidence like this one at homes,” Mulaudzi said. With winter approaching, the City said that it would be embarking on campaigns aimed at educating the public about the dangers of leaving children alone.
