Zodidi Mhlana JOHANNESBURG- Police Commissioner General Khehla Sitole has commended the conviction and sentencing of a mother who protected the man who raped her infant in November 2016. The 29-year-old woman from Meadowlands whose identity cannot be disclosed to protect her child was found guilty last year and given a life sentence on Wednesday for aiding the rape of her child. The baby who was severely injured after the rape that occurred in November 2016 had to undergo surgery. The National Commissioner applauded the legal team for the successful prosecution. “Protecting the innocent and vulnerable is what we seek to ensure on a daily basis and both Sergeant Lekgoathi and Advocate Du Plooy have excelled in this regard. This may be little justice for the two-month-old baby but the outcome of this case will surely serve to deter such criminality from taking place again,” Sitole said. When the Orlando Family Violence Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit (FCS) conducted the investigation into the matter after it was reported to them, the mother claimed that the baby sustained her injuries after falling from bed. But, a medical report revealed that the infant had been raped and semen was found in her genitals. The woman was then apprehended and charged with aiding, abetting child abuse and defeating the ends of justice. The perpetrator of the crime is unknown. The case was heard at the South Gauteng high court since November last year. @Mhlana
