JOHANNESBURG, April 29  – SA batsman Hashim Amla was on Saturday honoured with the Order of Ikhamanga for his contribution in the field of sports. The Order of Ikhamanga is one of the national honours issued by the President of South Africa, given in recognition of services and achievements in arts, culture, literature, music, journalism or sport. Amla, 35, has played 117 Tests, 164 ODIs, and 43 T20Is – with 17794 international runs against his name. He also holds the record for the highest individual score by a South African: an unbeaten 311 against England at The Oval in 2012. The South African batsman was named as a silver award recipient by the Chancellor of National Orders Cassius Lubisi earlier this week. “He has brought pride to our country with his many batting firsts in the international cricket arena and remains one of the leading batsmen of our time,” said Lubisi. After being named in the honours list, Amla, who is currently playing county cricket for Hampshire in England, dedicated the award to the people of South Africa. Amla is the first South African batsman to receive the prestigious award. In 2008, former fast bowlers Shaun Pollock and Makhaya Ntini were both honoured, while the inaugural award was received by South Africa-born English batsman Basil D’Oliveira in 2003. ANA
