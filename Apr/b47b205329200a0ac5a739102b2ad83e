PORT ELIZABETH, April 10 – A Nelson Mandela Bay special council sitting once again collapsed amid chaos on Tuesday, this time over tributes to anti-apartheid Struggle icon Winnie Mandela who died last week. The re-scheduled meeting was meant to deal with six motions, including a motion sponsored by the Economic Freedom Fighters to have Mayor Athol Trollip and Speaker Jonathan Lawack ousted. The meeting, though, got underway with each political party given five minutes to pay tribute to Madikizela-Mandela who died aged 81. However, before Nqaba Bhanga from the Democratic Alliance (DA) was able to pay tribute to Madikizela-Mandela, affectionately known as the “Mother of the Nation”, opposition parties raised strong objections. The meeting then descended into chaos, with some councillors accusing Speaker Lawack of being biased. The EFF’s Zilindile Vena was adamant that Bhanga should not speak because he “did not stand for anything Mama Winnie fought for”. The African National Congress (ANC) meanwhile accused Bhanga of murder. Lawack stood up on several occasions while opposition councillors from the floor continued to hurl insults at Bhanga. When Bhanga eventually started speaking he was drowned out by singing from EFF and ANC councillors. Shortly afterwards, Lawack adjourned the meeting. DA councillors left the chamber while opposition parties continued to sing songs in tribute to Madikizela-Mandela and remained in the council chamber. – African News Agency (ANA)
