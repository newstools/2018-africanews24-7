BAKU (Reuters) – Red Bull Formula One drivers Max Verstappen and Daniel Ricciardo collided in Sunday’s Azerbaijan Grand Prix while running fourth and fifth, putting both out of the race. Australian Ricciardo, the race winner in China two weekends ago and in Baku last year, smashed into the back of his 20-year-old Dutch team mate’s car while attempting to overtake on the 40th of 51 laps. The incident brought out the safety car for the second time in the race.
