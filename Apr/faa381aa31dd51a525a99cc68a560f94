Zodidi Mhlana As hundreds of people are expected to march ahead of former President Jacob Zuma’s court appearance, motorists have been cautioned to plan their travelling as some routes will be affected. The Durban Metropolitan Police Services spokesperson Parboo Sewpersad said that the march will commence in the morning and affect several routes within the City centre. “We appeal to motorists to plan their routes carefully for tomorrow and to practice patience in the expected traffic congestion. Motorists should also find alternative routes where possible and stay away from the High Court precinct, ie. the entrance and exit of the Nkosi Albert Luthuli Freeway Joseph Ndluli (Russell) Street and Margaret Mncadi Avenue,” Metro police Spokesman, Parboo Sewpersad said. Sewpersad said that metro police will be available to assist motorist and divert traffic. The march will start at King Dinizulu Park and move along Dr Pixley KaSeme and then marchers will turn into Yusuf Dadoo street, and Margaret Mncadi avenue before going to court. Zuma is appearing at the Durban high court on Friday. The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) is pursuing several charges against the former president who stepped down this year. Some of the charges that the NPA reinstated against Zuma include 16 charges include fraud, corruption, money-laundering and racketeering in relation to myriad payments Zuma received from his former financial adviser Schabir Shaik.
