Nigerian born Dr. Bunmi Ojewole will take-on South Africa’s ‘Demolition’ Jacqualine Trosee in the co-main event of EFC 70, Africa’s premium mixed martial arts competition. According to the EFC promoters, Ojewole is a natural athlete. “The pure love for competition can always be seen on her face and it is clearly where she is happiest. The orthopedic surgeon is a dichotomy in the world of combat sports. In one part of her life, she breaks bones, in the other she mends them,” the EFC said in a statement. Fighting out of Lion’s Den, Durban, she recently came second at the Abu Dhabi BJJ World Pro. Trosee is a South African Muay Thai champion. According to the EFC, “She is deadly on her feet with her strikes. A woman made of true grit, a never say die attitude; she comes to brawl.” EFC 70 takes place on Saturday 26 May live from Sibaya, Durban.
