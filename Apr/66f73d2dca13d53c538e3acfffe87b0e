JOHANNESBURG, April 18 – Barbara Bush, described by CBS News in the US as a “witty, gregarious matriarch of a political dynasty that propelled two of its members to the White House” died Tuesday after a series of recent hospitalizations. The office of George H.W. Bush announced her passing. She died at the age of 92. Reports from the US said the former first lady had decided not to seek additional medical treatment and instead sought comfort care at her Houston home, where she died. “My dear mother has passed on at age 92. Laura, Barbara, Jenna, and I are sad, but our souls are settled because we know hers was. Barbara Bush was a fabulous First Lady and a woman unlike any other who brought levity, love, and literacy to millions,” CBS quoted former president George W. Bush as saying late Tuesday night. “To us, she was so much more. Mom kept us on our toes and kept us laughing until the end. I’m a lucky man that Barbara Bush was my mother. Our family will miss her dearly, and we thank you all for your prayers and good wishes.” – African News Agency (ANA)
