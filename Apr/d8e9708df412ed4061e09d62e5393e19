People on Social Media were left reeling with answers as former minister Sydney Mufumadi briefed the media about what he said was setting the record straight about accusations made in a recent documentary about Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. There were questions that people felt were left unanswered, while others refused to listen to him, saying he is spinning. Others were grateful for him speaking. Please feed the younger generation the truth, they will tear each other apart. Why should we do Stratcom’s job says #SydneyMufamadi @ANN7tv @The_New_Age — Cecilia Russell (@CiciRussell) April 16, 2018  “… feed them the truth …”#SydneyMufamadi pic.twitter.com/rRkHeqllMq — Nthabi (@anonymousnthabi) April 16, 2018  #SydneyMufamadi he said we are fighting over nothing….. really — Simunye (@Simunye93150699) April 16, 2018  #SydneyMufamadi History 101. — Black Not Swart! (@DipuoKekae_) April 16, 2018  Former Safety and Security minister #SydneyMufamadi, frothing at the mouth, says that he gave the go-ahead for Pascale Lamche’s documentary “Winnie” despite not being given the right of reply. Really? How do you say okay to something but can’t state your view about allegations? — Sphelele (@SpheDludla) April 16, 2018  #SydneyMufamadi is right about one thing, we are now fighting amongst ourselves, umtyholi uphole upstairs. — RatoTheTaurean (@LeratoLekhula) April 16, 2018  If #SydneyMufamadi knew Mama #WinnieMadikizelaMandela in the manner the is saying he did they he would have never authorized that investigation into her knowing pretty well that it was being instigated by Tony Leon. pic.twitter.com/DgetvZMowH — Lé Éminence Grise ?? (@Panacea_ZA) April 16, 2018  #SydneyMufamadi Communication 101: Simplicity is key….Comrade Sydney runs the risk that after this press conference people will be more confused than when he started speaking… — Freddy Pilusa (@FreddyPilusa) April 16, 2018  This presser is not addressing the pertinent question. Did you or did you not instruct the police to reopen the investigation against our mother and if so, under whose instruction? #SydneyMufamadi — Tshianeo (@Tshianeo_M) April 16, 2018  Mufamadi is supposed to be setting records straight on the claims that he instructed Heslinga to reopen investigations on Winnie in an attempt to criminalize her. #SydneyMufamadi — Keagh (@I_Liveth) April 16, 2018  I need a bucket of coffee to continue listening to #SydneyMufamadi. Yhuu! ? Bangibekezele. — Sbu Mpungose (@SbuMpungose) April 16, 2018  In essence, is #SydneyMufamadi saying that the #WinnieDocumentary was to divide the ANC? Questions he must then answer are: for what motive, by whom (name names). If he knew about the doccie when it was made why didn’t he set the record straight then?
Too many questions… — Phindz (@keletso30933369) April 16, 2018  I just imagined the TRC reloaded, held by black Twitter. We are grown, educated and understand things better than we did. Also our purpose would be clear… To heal #WinnieDoccie #Winnie #SydneyMufamadi — Bhoza Mphela (@MissBhoza) April 16, 2018  it has become clear that the role played by UDF in the emancipation of SA and subsequent democratic dispensation post 94 has never been fully acknowledged or has been purposely underplayed#SydneyMufamadi #WinnieDoccie #Stratcom40 — Mondli Hubba Ngcobo (@mpngcobo85) April 16, 2018  Wait!!! #SydneyMufamadi is complaining that the Narrative of #WinnieMandela in the documentary was told by Apartheid agent, yet he, himself requested apartheid agents to reinstate charges against her?? Ithini lento? — Graeme Mkhalimi k (@Graeme_MK) April 16, 2018  @Julius_S_Malema please listen to this history lesson from #SydneyMufamadi stop ? it with your naivety and cut this tendency of misleading and misinforming people .@palesa_morudu @osipuka @ali_naka @MbuyiseniNdlozi @nombonisogasa — MalcomX (@AfterTheBeamer) April 16, 2018  People like Dr Mufamadi wait for kak to hit then fan then realise ‘ Oh, my reputation has been tainted I need to respond”. No chief. #SydneyMufamadi — Jobe SC Sithole (@Jobza) April 16, 2018   If you knew Paul Erasmus was such a bad man of note. How are you unable to recall if you have ever met him one on one or with others? If he was such an individual of disrepute that stayed on your mind? Please don’t tell me nonsense! #sydneymufamadi — D (@wukster) April 16, 2018  This presser has opened more questions than answers, even STRATCOM journalists like Thandeka are speaking about themselves trying to clear her name instead of asking questions. #SydneyMufamadi — #RETnow (@SbuSheshani) April 16, 2018  #SydneyMufamadi why are you asking thandeka who killed stompie? hmmmm ku rough go masweee — ||•♡☆kattiey♡☆•|| (@Onalero01521117) April 16, 2018
