CAPE TOWN, April 22 – Just moments after ill-tempered fans invaded the Moses Mabhida Stadium on Saturday night Kaizer Chiefs broke the news that their beleaguered coach Steve Komphela had resigned. A mere two lines on Chiefs’ Twitter account informed: ‘Breaking News: Steve Komphela has resigned with immediate effect as head coach of Kaizer Chiefs!’ Chiefs had suffered an embarrassing 2-0 defeat at the hands of Free State Stars in the Nedbank Cup semifinal and that effectively ended AmaKhosi’s last chance of winning silverware this season. Following Komphela’s resignation, it also meant that the famous club has gone trophyless for 28 months while he was at the helm. As the match wound to a close and Chiefs trailing 2-0, TV footage showed a police riot vehicle moving in behind the Chiefs dugout and that was an indication that trouble was anticipated. There were tell-tale signs earlier as a variety of objects, mainly water bottles were pelted in the direction of the Chiefs dugout. However, when the referee blew the final whistle the Stadium security which had earlier been beefed up by a contingent of police armed with riot gear, was not prepared for what followed as hundreds of bad-tempered fans burst through the perimeter hoarding to invade the pitch. All hell broke loose as players and officials fed to the safety of the tunnel with security staff closing in to provide protection as fans ran amok, destroying advertising boards and TV equipment. Video footage, posted fans on social media platforms, showed fans attacking security staff. The two TV broadcasters who were at hand to do pitch-side post-match interviews fled to safety inside the stadium to conduct their business there. – African News Agency (ANA)
