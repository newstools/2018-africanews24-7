On Sunday 15 April 2018, Africa News 24-7 published an article with the headline: “Eskom employers accused of bribery to favor tech giant EOH”. The article alleges amongst others that EOH is presumably in pole position to secure five contracts totaling more than R2billion, despite it not allegedly meeting the mandatory minimum requirements. Whilst our team made an effort to contact EOH to request its right of reply, which was unsuccessful due to a technical glitch, it is arguable that further steps should have been taken to offer EOH its right of reply. Africa News 24-7 has as a result hereof retracted the article in its entirety and apologizes unreservedly to EOH and all those implicated in the article.”
