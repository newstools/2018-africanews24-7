Zodidi Mhlana JOHANNESBURG- A new-born baby has been discovered in a refuse bag in the CBD of Bloemfontein according to paramedics. When ER24 paramedics arrived at the scene on Thursday evening after being called by the police, the infant had already died. “Upon further assessment, paramedics found a new-born baby wrapped in a plastic bag inside the rubbish bag. Unfortunately, nothing more could be done by paramedics, and the baby was declared dead at the scene. It is believed that the baby was discovered by a man who had opened the refuse bag to search its contents,” ER24 said. While police are investigating the tragedy, details of how the baby was dumped are still not clear. Some say that there has been an increase in the number of babies being dumped across South Africa. Earlier this month, Port Elizabeth police announced that a newborn girl had been found dumped in a storm drain in the city. The baby which was found alive was rushed to the hospital. In July last year, paramedics found a baby boy and a fetus that had been dumped in separate areas in Johannesburg. According to officials, the majority of unwanted children are new-born babies. For nearly two decades, organizations such as the Door of Hope have been rescuing abandoned babies in and around Johannesburg through its Baby Bin, a hole built into in the wall. @Mhlana
