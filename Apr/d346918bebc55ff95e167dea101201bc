JOHANNESBURG, April 6 (ANA) – The South Gauteng High Court is on Friday, expected to rule on whether bail can be granted to convicted rapist and kwaito artist Sipho ‘Brickz’ Ndlovu, pending his appeal. The Roodepoort Magistrate’s Court found Ndlovu guilty of raping a relative and he was sentenced to 15 years on October 17. His leave to appeal his conviction has been granted by the South Gauteng High Court. The “Sweetie my baby” hitmaker was found guilty of raping his relative at his home in Ruimsig in 2013. The rape survivor, who can not be named, did not attend the hearing owing to the publicity the trial was generating. On September 28, her impact report was read by the State prosecutor, Pratisha Salie. “Malume [uncle] you have really hurt me. I ask myself what I did for you to rape me. I wanted you to treat me like your daughter but you didn’t. I will never be able to be proud of myself and I can’t trust anyone. I will have flashbacks for the rest of my life,” the report read. Ndlovu was arrested in November 2013.
