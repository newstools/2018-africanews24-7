Zodidi Mhlana JOHANNESBURG- With 17 Palestinians who have been killed by Israel military in recent times, the South African government has joined the international community in calling for an independent investigation into the killings. At least 17 Palestinians have died and hundreds were injured during clashes with the Israel military during a recent march in Gaza. International Relations and Cooperation Minister, Lindiwe Sisulu said those responsible for these deaths should be held liable for their actions. “The actions of the Israeli armed forces present yet another obstacle to a permanent resolution to the conflict, which must come in the form of two states, Palestine and Israel, existing side-by-side and in peace. South Africa aligns itself with those members of the United Nations calling for an independent inquiry into the killings, with a view to holding to account those who are responsible,” Sisulu said. The Israel government has however defended the killings claiming that Palestinian protestors started throwing stones and rolling burning tires and fired shots toward military members. Sisulu said that the government Israel soldiers should move out of Gaza Strip in order to end the latest violence. Earlier, the United Nations and European Union called for a probe into the latest violence. However, Israel Defence minister Avigdor Lieberman was quoted as saying: “From the standpoint of Israel soldiers, they did what had to be done. I think that all troops deserve a commendation.” @Mhlana
