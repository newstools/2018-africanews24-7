JOHANNESBURG, April 12 – A man, believed to be in his 40s, was killed and a three-year-old child injured Thursday morning following a shooting outside a residence on Moagi Street in Ivory Park, Johannesburg. ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring said when paramedics arrived on the scene at 06h40 they found local authorities and other provincial emergency services already in attendance. “Upon closer inspection, paramedics found a vehicle parked along the road outside a residence. The body of a man, believed to be in his 40s, was found lying in the driver’s seat of the vehicle,” said Meiring. “Paramedics assessed the man and found that he had sustained a fatal gunshot wound. Unfortunately, nothing could be done for the man and he was declared dead by Provincial Services.” Inside the house, paramedics found a three-year-old boy, who had sustained a gunshot wound to his leg. “Paramedics treated the boy and provided him with pain-relief medication before he was transported to a nearby hospital for further treatment,” said Meiring. Local authorities were on the scene and are investigating. – African News Agency (ANA)
