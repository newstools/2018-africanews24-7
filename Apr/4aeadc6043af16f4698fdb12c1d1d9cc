BRISBANE, April 12 – Caster Semenya kept her chances of collecting double gold alive, as she booked her place in the 800 metres final, after her morning heat at the Commonwealth Games at Australia’s Gold Coast on Thursday. Semenya, who earlier in the week took gold in the 1500 metres final in a new Commonwealth and national best time of 4 min 00.71 secs, had little trouble in winning her 800 metres heat in 1:59.26 to advance to Friday’s final. Over 800 metres, the South African won gold at the 2012 and 2016 Olympics, as well as 2009, 2011 and 2017 World Championship events. She also took the 1500 metres bronze at the World Championships in London last year. In the T12 100 metres for athletes with disabilities, both Jonathan Ntutu and Hilton Langenhoven advanced to the evening final. In the heats, Ntutu clocked a Games record of 10.80 while Langenhoven set a season-best of 11.27. – African News Agency (ANA)
