Zodidi Mhlana JOHANNESBURG- Police have launched a manhunt for 16 awaiting prisoners who escaped from the Johannesburg Correctional service on Monday morning. Correctional Services department spokesperson Singabakho Nxumalo said the prisoners escaped through a shaft pipe at around 03:00 on Monday after using an object to break the wall. “A total of 16 inmates escaped from Johannesburg Correctional Centre Medium A which houses remand detainees. They broke the window and broke a portion of a wall and the fence and escaped through the fence. The department is currently doing an investigation. We have also launched a manhunt, we are working together with the police,” Nxumalo said. Nxumalo said that seven of the escaped prisoners had been arrested for murder, three for rape and other for robbery and housebreaking. Nkosiyazi Phungula, 27, Ntobeko Hlatswayo, 32, and Sabelo Ngubane,30, from Zimbabwe were all set to appear on murder charges on April 16. The department said that the issue of prisoners escaping was concerning. “We are concerned, even if it is just one inmate, it’s an issue. No inmate should find a way to escape. If you have 15, it definitely says there was a security breach and as the department, we have to prevent other similar accidents from happening,” Last month, six sentenced inmates escaped from Pollsmoor’ prison in Cape Town after removing bars with a piece of metal. They were all re-arrested within three days. @Mhlana
