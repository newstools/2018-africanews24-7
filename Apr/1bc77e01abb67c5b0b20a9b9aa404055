JOHANNESBURG, April 24 – Twenty-three students at the Islamic University in Uganda (IUIU) have challenged the university’s decision to suspend them for one year for allegedly indulging in sexual activities on campus. Uganda’s Daily Monitor reported on Tuesday that the students concerned had written to the university management for a review of the decision by the disciplinary committee which held that they were caught coupling in dark corners at the campus, contrary to university regulations. The students wrote to the management after they were given a week to appeal the decision if they felt the punishment was unjustified. IUIU, a 30-year-old institution, has strict Islamic guidelines which forbids physical touch involving hugging and kissing between students of the opposite sex and is also one of the few universities that runs an all-female campus at Kabojja on the outskirts of the capital Kampala. One of the recent suspension cases involved a student who was suspended for consuming alcohol and was subsequently forced to write one hundred apologies which were pinned on all campus notice boards together with his picture. Other suspended students were found guilty by the university disciplinary committee of consuming narcotics and alcohol, among other offences. – African News Agency (ANA)
