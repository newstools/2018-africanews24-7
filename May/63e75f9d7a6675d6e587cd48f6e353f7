Zodidi Mhlana JOHANNESBURG- Former African National Congress MP Dr. Makhosi Khoza has joined the Organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (OUTA) as the executive director of the group’s local government programme. Dr. Khoza who recently announced that she was leaving politics became one of former president Jacob Zuma’s outspoken critics while part of the ruling party. Last year Khoza left the ANC to launch her own political party, the African Democratic Change (ADeC). She said that problems which including poor service delivery and widespread corruption should be dealt with within municipalities. “I hope to make a maximum impact on this sphere of governance. We pay property rates in order to get quality, effective and efficient municipal services. Sadly, the local governance sphere is riddled with corruption, incompetency, poor services. The government needs to be assisted through pointing out these challenges, providing practical and effective solutions to them as well as ensuring that the necessary capacity is built,” she said. Her appointment was announced at a briefing on Friday morning. Khoza said that despite the challenges that local government was dealing with, it was neglected. “Everyone in this room would concur with the fact that despite local government being the closest sphere of government in South Africa, it is ironically and tragically, the most neglected. When she resigned from ADeC, Dr. Khoza said that she wanted to focus on issues which were passionate about including local government. OUTA said that it was confident that Khoza would have an impact on local government structure. @Mhlana
