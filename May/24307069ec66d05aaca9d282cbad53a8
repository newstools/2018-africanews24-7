Zodidi Mhlana Trade unions involved in the ongoing bus strike on Monday said that they would be approaching the bargaining council so that talks between parties can resume this week. The nationwide bus strike has been ongoing for more than two weeks after parities failed to reach a wage agreement on several occasions. Satawu spokesperson, Zanele Sabela said that it was in the best interest to resume wage negotiations. “Unions met today (Monday) and decided they would write to the bargaining council to request a meeting of all parties so that we can continue with talks within this week. The stalemate is not good for anyone, for us, the workers and commuters,” Sabela said. Last week, parties failed reach an agreement even though Labour and Transport ministers had intervened to end the deadlock. About 17 000 bus drivers affiliated to South African Transport and Allied Workers’ Union (Satawu), National Union of Metalworkers of SA (Numsa) and other three unions downed tools over two weeks ago after wage talks with employer organisations, Commuter Bus Employers Organisation and South African Bus Employers Association (Sabea) collapsed. The industrial action left thousands of commuters stranded countrywide and forced them to use alternative transport. Long distance commuters have been affected as well. Initially, unions demanded a 12% increase while the employers were offering seven %. During last week’s negotiations, unions lowered their demand to 8,5% for the first year and demanded 8% for the second year, but employers offered 7.5% for the first year. Trade unions also want issue of night shift allowance and dual bus drivers to be resolved.
