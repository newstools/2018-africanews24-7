Zodidi Mhlana JOHANNESBURG- Everything came to a standstill this morning when angry Metrobus commuters blocked buses from operating in and around Gandhi Square complaining about late and unreliable buses. Commuters used dustbins and other objects to block buses from entering and exiting Gandhi Square claiming that Metro buses were often delayed or not arriving at all. Johannesburg Metro police Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar said: “commuters are now in a meeting with Metrobus management. They have been protesting about a new bus schedule which they said it was making them late for work.” Metrobus spokesperson, Goodwill Shiburi said that their problems were exacerbated by the recent nation-wide bus strike. “We were forced to overload our buses during the strike and a number of buses broke down and now we are trying to fix them. We will have them ready in a month’s time. We will also be procuring new busses during the start of the financial year which begins in July. We are talking to commuters now and we hope that our buses will be running in two hours,” Shiburi said. Commuters said that they had received written warnings at work as a result of the unreliable buses. “Since February, I’ve been arriving at Gandhi Square at 6 am, but the bus often comes an hour late on a daily basis. We’ve written letters and petitions to the bus company, but all our pleas have fallen on deaf ears. I’m forever late at work even though I’m always on time. Inspectors who are supposed to be assisting us at Gandhi Square become rude when we question them about the delays,” Zamo Sibiya who works in Morning Side said on Wednesday morning. @Mhlana
