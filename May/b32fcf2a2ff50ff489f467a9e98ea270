South Korea wants U.S. troops to stay on the Korean peninsula. That’s according to a South Korean presidential spokesperson who said on Wednesday (May 2) that American forces should stay whether or not a peace treaty is signed with the North. The spokesperson from South Korea’s Blue House also said the issue is solely between the U.S. and South Korea. The statement comes after a presidential advisor created confusion on President Moon Jae-in’s stance in a column published earlier this week. The column said it would be difficult to justify the presence of U.S. forces in South Korea if a peace treaty is signed. But another presidential official told Reuters that Seoul wants U.S. troops to remain because it believes they can play the role of mediator in any future confrontations between South Korea and Asian neighbors like China and Japan. While the North has long demanded that the 28,500 American troops be withdrawn as one of the conditions for denuclearization, there was no mention of troop withdrawal in last week’s declaration by Moon Jae-In and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Kim and Moon did announce they would work for complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula following the historic inter-Korea talks. The two Koreas also said they’d work with the United States and China this year to declare an official end to the Korean War, and establish a permanent peace agreement. American troops have been stationed in South Korea for over 60 years.
