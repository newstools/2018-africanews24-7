Africa News reporter JOHANNESBURG- South Africans have taken to social media to express their dismay after Gqom musician Babes Wodumo was confronted in a radio interview about the abuse she suffered at the hands of her former fiance and fellow musician Mampintsha. Thank you #Masechaba, we salute you for being masechaba for real. We need more like you in our country, continue to stand against and expose women abuse. — Julius Sello Malema (@Julius_S_Malema) May 19, 2018  This broke my heart so much. Was listening to this interview with my son. ? https://t.co/oSNx9NNBtb — Jabba™ (@HipHopPantsula) May 18, 2018  Just watched the live video on her page and this is the convo that occurred in studio before they went back on air and spoke about what really happened to Babes. From my view this doesn’t come from a place of wanting to boost ratings. I feel for Babes ? pic.twitter.com/yC2BKuHXEy — Dreamchaser (@KingKhanya91) May 18, 2018  I’m soooo unsettled by that babes interview!!! — Thando Thabooty (@Thando_Thabethe) May 18, 2018  Letsatsi lagago latla wena, kolobe ya naga @MampintshaNuz — Boity Thulo (@Boity) May 18, 2018
