Sello Theletsane JOHANNESBURG- Arsenal FC have appointed former PSG boss Unai Emery as their new manager after 22-years following the departure of Arsene Wenger. The club’s website said the 46-year-old joins as head coach, having spent the last two years at Paris St Germain and previously leading Sevilla to a Europa League treble. In announcing the appointment, Arsenal’s chief executive Ivan Gazidis said: “Unai has an outstanding track record of success throughout his career, has developed some of the best young talents in Europe and plays a progressive style of football that fits Arsenal perfectly. “His hard-work, passionate approach and his sense of values on and off the pitch make him the ideal person to take us forward,” said Ivan Gazidis. Having taken over in 1996 from Pat Rice, Wenger’s final season in charge of the Gunners ended in disappointment with Arsenal finishing sixth in the Premier League and missing out on Champions League qualification for the second season in a row. @SelloTheletsane
