Zodidi Mhlana JOHANNESBURG- A Mpumalanga teenager Katlego Marite who was abducted not far from his home in eMalahleni on Sunday has been found according to the police. While it remains unclear whether a ransom was paid, he was found in good health. “Katlego was found, but we are not at liberty to divulge more information. He’s about to be reunited with his family. He was found around Witbank, we can’t say where exactly he was found because we are still investigating the matter. Weather a ransom was paid or not, that’s part of our investigation. More details would be revealed later,” Mpumalanga police spokesperson Leonard Hlathi said. Marite, 13, was abducted on Sunday afternoon while playing with his two friends in Tasbetpark Extension three in eMalahleni in Mpumalanga. His kidnappers demanded to be paid a ransom of R1,5m in the form of bitcoin for his release. In a letter, the kidnappers demanded 15 bitcoins and asked the family not to involve the police. Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency. “It was reported that a car arrived where Katleho was playing with his friends. A man dressed in black snatched the boy and put him inside the car. The man also sped off. The two boys that were left behind then reported the matter to Katlego’s mother. Subsequent to that a case was opened. The police management put a team which was concentrating on his kidnapping,” Hlathi said. @Mhlana
