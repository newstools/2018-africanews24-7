EUGENE, USA, May 27  – Caster Semenya’s world dominance on the middle distance scene continued at the Diamond League meeting held in Eugene, US, on Saturday, as she cruised to victory in the 800 metres event. Having already collected the top honours in the 1500 metres at the Diamond League meeting in Doha earlier this month, the Olympic and world 800 metres champion crossed the finish line in the two-lap race in 1 minutes 55.92 secs. Next best was American Ajee Wilson in 1:56.86. The South African’s finishing power has been simply too much for any opponent on the international scene in recent times. Anaso Jobodwana’s time of 20.42 in the 200 metres was only good enough to give him a fourth spot on the night, with the win going to American Noah Lyles in 19.69. The other South African in action on the night in the form of Dominique Scott-Efurd, managed to clocked a career-best time of 15: 10.23 in the 5000 metres, but it was only good enough to give her an 8th-place finish. The win went the way of Ethiopian Genzebe Dibaba in 14:26.89. The Diamond League action will now shift to Rome for the 4th leg of the lucrative 14-event circuit takes place on Thursday. May 31. ANA
