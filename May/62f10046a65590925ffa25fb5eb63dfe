JOHANNESBURG, May 30 – Premier Soccer League Chairman Irvin Khoza on Tuesday paid tribute to Bantu Holomisa and Zodwa Zwane. Khoza was speaking at the PSL Awards held in Johannesburg. The two were recipients of the annual Chairman’s Award. “The Chairman’s award celebrates the achievements and good deeds of people in our society. For 2018, this award goes to two people who have made a special contribution to our lives and also our football. We honor General Holomisa and Ms. Zodwa Zwane,” Khoza said. “The history of General Holomisa and his contribution to this country has not yet been told. He is a man who is passionate about football but that is not a new thing, General Holomisa was amongst the people who backed us many years ago while he was chairman of Tembu Royals FC (in Mthatha). “Ms. Zodwa Zwane was by Mama Winnie Mandela’s side and took care of Mama Winnie. We just want to say thank you for looking after our icon and being there for her. Winnie Mandela has a special place in our history.” – African News Agency (ANA)
