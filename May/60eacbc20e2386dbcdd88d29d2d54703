LONDON, May 15 – Britain’s Competition and Markets
Authority said it will examine whether a takeover of Lonmin
by South Africa’s Sibanye-Stillwater would reduce competition,
knocking shares in both mining firms. Precious metals miner Sibanye-Stillwater made an all-share
offer for London-listed Lonmin in December, but the planned 285
million pounds ($386 million) deal to create the world’s No.2
platinum producer faces several other hurdles. These include Lonmin’s shrinking cash balance, a stronger
rand and competition approval in South Africa. Shares in cash-strapped Lonmin, the world’s third-largest
platinum producer had slipped 4 percent in London by 1554 GMT,
while Sibanye, the fourth-largest, saw its stock close down 5.3
percent in Johannesburg. “The longer the delay, the greater the potential for
transaction failure, since the likelier it would be that Lonmin
would be in net debt,” Shore Capital analyst Yuen Low said. “Even supposing the CMA approved the transaction, there
could be delayed to the transaction,” Low said of the deal which
is scheduled to close in the second half of the year. If the deal is blocked it would trigger Lonmin’s debt
covenants and require the platinum miner to pay $150 million in
20 days after credit waivers were granted by Lonmin’s lenders in
January, preventing it from defaulting. Lonmin and Sibanye predict 12,600 Lonmin jobs will be cut in
the next three years as expensive production is wound down and
layoffs are a central issue for competition approval in South
Africa, where unemployment runs at about 28 percent. However, if the merger were delayed or blocked it could
place all Lonmin’s 33,000 jobs at risk, Lonmin Chief Executive
Ben Magara said on Monday after its results. -(Reuters)
