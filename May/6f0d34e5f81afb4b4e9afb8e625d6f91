JOHANNESBURG, May 18 – Robbers armed with assault
rifles and explosives blew up two armoured cash-carrying vans in
Johannesburg this week in a brazen broad-daylight incident that
underscored South Africa’s reputation for violent crime. In dramatic cell-phone footage of the incident recorded by a
motorist, the assailants seal off a block in the suburb of
Boksburg, east of Johannesburg’s commercial center, before
calmly detonating explosives under the cash vans.  You dont know money wena trust me! #Boksburg pic.twitter.com/Ugs2p4nC7E — Aaron Duzz (@DuzzAaron) May 17, 2018  Three large explosions are heard, with plumes of grey smoke
shooting up into the air. There are also rapid exchanges of
gunfire before and after the blasts, although it is not clear
where the shots were coming from. The assailants, who numbered around a dozen, then load sacks
into at least two get-away cars before speeding away. Motorists
caught up in the shoot-out are seen pulling U-turns across the
road to escape the scene.  pic.twitter.com/W1Ji8tvSSs — #vendafollowtrain (@ace_mpho) May 17, 2018  Police said two security guards in the cash vans were
injured in the incident and were treated in hospital. They also
said some of the robbers were arrested after being tracked by
helicopter to a run-down industrial park.  Security experts quoted in South African media said the way
the assailants behaved and handled the weapons suggested they
had military backgrounds. -(Reuters)
