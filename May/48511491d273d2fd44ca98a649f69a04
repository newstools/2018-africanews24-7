JOHANNESBURG, May 10 – Thousands of people on Wednesday attended the funeral of Mozambican rebel and opposition leader Afonso Dhlakama, with the country’s president Filipe Nyusi and Dhlakama’s successor Ossufo Momade pledging to forge ahead with peace talks, AP reported. Dhlakama died at age 65 last week in his rural hideout in central Mozambique, where he had run a renewed military campaign against the southern African nation’s government after pulling out of a 1992 peace accord that ended 16 years of civil war in which about 1 million people were killed. – African News Agency (ANA)
