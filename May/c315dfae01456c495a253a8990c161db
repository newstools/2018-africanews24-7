CAPE TOWN, May 14 – Though the crippling nationwide bus strike in South Africa was called off on Monday after workers and employers reached an agreement, some bus companies such as the Gautrain said on Tuesday that their operations would not resume immediately. In a statement issued shortly before 6 am, the Gautrain said that the early morning bus service was not available due to a bus driver meeting taking place. Buses were dispatched after the meeting. Long-distance coach Greyhound and Citiliner also said that its services resumed on Monday, but all routes would only be fully operational from Wednesday. Reya Vaya, MyCiTi, and A Re Yeng – the bus rapid transit systems in Johannesburg, Cape Town, and Tshwane respectively – were back in operation on Tuesday. Thousands of bus drivers downed tools a month ago, demanding wage increases and better working conditions. On Monday, five unions agreed and signed a new offer including a nine percent across-the-board wage increase for the first year and eight percent for the second year. – African News Agency (ANA)
