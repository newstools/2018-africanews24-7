JOHANNESBURG, May 24 – The Minister of Higher Education and Training Naledi Pandor on Thursday said she was shocked by the murder of University of Zululand’s Chairperson of the Senate, Professor Gregory Kamwendo, who was gunned down outside his residence in Empangeni, north of Durban, on Tuesday. Pandor said she has recently met Professor Kamwendo when she visited the University of Zululand – not just as part of familiarising herself with the various universities across the country, but also as an attempt to find solutions to the challenges faced by the institution. “Prof Kamwendo spoke passionately about the efforts they were embarking on as the Senate to cleanse the University of the unfortunate consequences and perceptions it had had to address as a result of the scandals related to the criminal sale of degrees, which the university had worked hard to correct,” Pandor said. Professor Kamwendo, 53, had led a team of Senate members who had made a presentation to the minister about their efforts to bring credibility to all academic programmes on offer at the University of Zululand. Pandor said she was saddened that such a promising academic’s life was senselessly cut short. “I plead with our law enforcement agencies to leave no stone unturned to bring the culprits to book. On behalf of myself and my department, I send our heartfelt condolences to Prof Kamwendo’s family, relatives, friends and UniZulu’s community at large. May his soul rest in peace,” Pandor said. – African News Agency (ANA)
