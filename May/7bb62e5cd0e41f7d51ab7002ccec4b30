WINDHOEK, MAY 21 – Apartheid is still being practiced in Namibia as some farm labourers children are denied access to education, former President Sam Nujoma has said. He was speaking here on Friday at the handing over of a cash donation by Omakutu Fishing Company towards the primary school on his farm near Otavi. Nujoma said farmers take their own children to expensive schools while their employees children stay on the farms without an education.  This is why I decided to build this school as my small contribution for these children of the marginalised communities living in the area, he said. Nujoma said the construction of the school itself has been completed and they are now concentrating on completing the hostel, after which the school will be officially handed over to the Ministry of Education, Arts and Culture. The hostel is expected to be completed early next year. Nujoma has also built a clinic at Farm Etunda, which has been handed over to the Ministry of Health and Social Services, to assist the communities living on and near the farm. Omakutu Fishing Company donated N. dollars 2 500. (NAMPA) 
