JOHANNESBURG, May 4 – Journalists from all over the world, who gathered in Ghana’s capital Accra to mark the United Nations World Press Freedom Day on Thursday, have released a communiqué calling for an end to attacks on them in their line of work. Dubbed the Accra Declaration, over 900 journalists also called for an end to other restrictions on press freedom, urging governments to provide protection for journalists and combat impunity when such attacks do occur, Ghana Web reported on Friday. The scribes further urged governments to ensure that those responsible for threats or attacks against journalists, media outlets, and others exercising their freedom of expression be brought to justice through fair and impartial proceedings. The communiqué called for the strengthening of the economic environment for quality journalism, investigative journalism and an independent professional media. An appeal was made to civil society and the academia to denounce attacks on freedom of expression and media freedom in any form and from any group or individual. Fair and equitable working conditions, as well as insurance for journalists, were also demands outlined in the journalists’ communiqué. The group also said the promotion of universal access to the internet at affordable prices was essential. Finally, participants called on UNESCO to support and train journalists in the area of digital safety and security, including the use of open and other technologies. – African News Agency (ANA)
