Zodidi Mhlana JOHANNESBURG- Forex trader Sandile Mantsoe has been convicted of killing his former girlfriend Karabo Mokoena. Mantsoe was accused of murdering his 22-year-old girlfriend, burning her remains and dumping them into an open field in Lyndhurst in April last year. He stabbed her to death. Delivering his judgement at the Gauteng high court on Wednesday, judge Peet Johnson described Mantsoe as an unreliable witness. The judge said that he was satisfied that the state was able to prove beyond doubt that Mantsoe had murdered Mokoena. Mantsoe was found guilty of assault and defeating the ends of justice During the trial, Mantsoe had claimed that Mokoena had abused him. He denied killing Mokoena saying that she had committed suicide. He said that Mokoena wanted to kill herself as she was depressed. Mantsoe was in a relationship with Mokoena for over three years even though he was married. The judge said that even though Mantsoe had planned Mokoena’s killing, it was not premeditated. Mokoena’s younger sister testified that her sister ex-boyfriend used to assault her. Mokoena’s remains were discovered in a veld and her ex-boyfriend had used acid pool and petrol to set alight the body. The state early this week closed its case after witnesses which included police officer, security guards, and Mokoena’s younger sister had given evidence. Sentencing has been scheduled for Thursday. @Mhlana
