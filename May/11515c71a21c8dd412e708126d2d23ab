JOHANNESBURG, May 31 (ANA) – The SA Football Association (Safa) is pleased with the progress made at the Provincial Technical Officers (PTO) induction workshop being held in Johannesburg this week. The meeting aims to equip the provincial representatives on matters pertaining to the national teams, schools football and provincial leagues. Safa’s Chief Executive Officer Dennis Mumble said the appointment of the PTO was a progressive step for the association in decentralising the workload. “This appointment is a huge relief and I am happy to inform you that you have a significant role to play in the provinces. It is the responsibility of the PTOs to ensure that all regions are functioning, and that football is running smoothly,” said Mumble at the workshop. Mumble said it was the prerogative of the PTOs to ensure that all provinces are on the same page with regards to football programmes and development. “As a PTO, you need to be the encyclopedia of your province and be able to give us all information at the Head office with regards to Competition Structures, Coaching Development, Player identification and development amongst many other issues within your areas, “ added Mumble. The induction workshop of the nine male and nine female provincial representatives, which began on Tuesday, will end on Thursday. – African News Agency (ANA)
