Beirut (dpa) – At least 12 paramilitaries were killed in overnight airstrikes believed to have been mounted by US-led coalition jets against at least two army positions in war-torn Syria, a monitoring group reported on Thursday. The dead were non-Syrian fighters loyal to the Syrian government, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights added without details. Syria’s state news agency SANA reported earlier Thursday that several government military posts, located between the Syrian desert and the Iraqi border, were hit by US-led airstrikes resulting in only material damage. A Syrian source close to the government, meanwhile, said the bombardment struck bases manned by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards allied with the Syrian government. The Lebanese Shiite Hezbollah movement, a close ally of both Iran and Damascus, said the strikes had targeted government positions in the desert of Deir al-Zour province in eastern Syria. In February, US-led coalition bombing in eastern Syria killed at least 45 Syrian government soldiers and their allies, the observatory reported at the time. Since 2014, the coalition has mainly targeted Islamic State in Syria where the radical organization has suffered military setbacks and lost ground in recent months.
