BENI, Democratic Republic of Congo, May 12 (Reuters) – A park ranger was killed and two British citizens were kidnapped on Friday in Democratic Republic of Congo’s Virunga National Park, a park service official and a local civil society leader said. Unidentified armed men ambushed the group in the morning
near the village of Kibati just north of Goma, the capital of
North Kivu province, said Mambo Kawaya, who heads a group of
local civil society organisations. The Congolese Institute for Nature Conservation (ICCN)
confirmed that one of its rangers was killed in the incident and
that two British nationals were among three people abducted. “For the moment the (ICCN) cannot communicate much about the
incident because the hostages are still in captivity. That would
put their lives in danger,” Joel Wenga, the ICCN’s head of
communications in North Kivu told Reuters. Britain’s Foreign Office said it was in contact with the
Congolese authorities “following an incident involving two
British nationals” and said its staff were providing support to
their families.
