JOHANNESBURG, May 21 – While Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta and opposition leader Raila Odinga have reached a fragile political truce following their unity deal earlier in the year, deported opposition activist Miguna Miguna has accused Odinga of abandoning him in his hour of need. Miguna, the Kenyan-born self-declared general of the National Resistance Movement (NRM), with Canadian citizenship, was deported from Nairobi’s international airport back to Canada in March in dramatic scenes which attracted international media coverage. In a scathing audio message from Canada on Sunday, Miguna also poked holes in the unity deal between Odinga and Kenyatta, saying it is only a matter of time before it collapses, given the history of “shared cynicism” the two have towards the citizenry, Kenya’s Daily Nation reported on Monday. Miguna’s anger followed Odinga accusing the fiery lawyer of being his own worst enemy with his behaviour likely to stoke political fires further. Miguna lambasted Odinga, accusing the former prime minister of political dictatorship and intolerance, and building “an edifice of political impunity within the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) where his word is like a fiat, or even the 10 commandments of God”.
