Zodidi Mhlana JOHANNESBURG- The brutal killing of a Meadowlands station commander who was gunned down outside his home in Protea South on Wednesday evening has been condemned. The senior officer was shot and killed outside his Soweto home after being accosted by a group of men. Brigadier Mathapelo Peters on Thursday said that preliminary investigations showed that he arrived at home before 7 pm. He died while being taken to a nearby hospital. Gauteng police Commissioner Deliwe De Lange described the killing as shocking. “Police will leave no stone unturned to find the perpetrators of these incessant and heartless attacks on our members. In fact, we will not be deterred or discouraged from staying true to our commitment and calling, which is to serve and to protect the residents of Gauteng and the country. On behalf of the leadership of Police in Gauteng, I wish to extend our deepest condolences to the family and colleagues of our slain member,” De Lange said. The Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on police Francois Beukman said the killing of police officers was gravely concerning. “The continuing shameless maiming of our police officers cannot continue unabated as it represents a direct attack on the rule of law. Also, the devastating effects it has on families is often untold, but life-changing. Similarly, the proliferation of arms used in such attacks remains a matter of concern, both for the portfolio committee and for South Africans in general. The committee calls on the South African Police Service to leave no stone unturned in finding and prosecuting the perpetrators of this heinous crime,” Beukman said.
