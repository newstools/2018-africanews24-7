JOHANNESBURG, May 21 – The case five men, aged between 26 and 42, who were arrested in connection with the cash-in-transit heist in Ekurhuleni, was postponed in the Boksburg Magistrate’s Court on Monday, for police to do profiling on the suspects. The men, Paul Sibanda, 28; Thato Gaopantwe, 26; Colin Hadebe, 42; Sibusiso Khumalo, 34; and Thabo Molefe, 32, made a brief appearance in court on Monday. The gang allegedly bombed two cash vehicles that were making their way to a bank from their depot in Kempton Park last Thursday. Videos of the crime scene went viral and a shoot-out ensued. Eight people, including security guards, were injured. During proceedings, State prosecutor Maria Fife said due to the firearms used, the offenses were classified as schedule six. “Police were not given identity documents of the accused for bail purposes,” Fife said. Fife told the court that there was a possibility of more arrests and requested a postponement. The men are facing charges of armed robbery with aggravating circumstances, possession of illegal firearms and explosives and ammunition, malicious damage to property and attempted murder. Through their legal representative, the men said they were assaulted by police during their arrest. Matter postponed to May 28. – African News Agency (ANA)
