Staff Reporter Reports are beginning to come in via Twitter and a shared picture and voice clips on WhatsApp of violence in Delft in Cape Town. In the WhatsApp note, the voice of a man says: “The fighting is between the blacks and the colored in the Delft area on the R300. There’s a lot of shooting and grenades are being thrown and a lot of people have been shot. It really looks bad. that area needs to be avoided at all costs. Other reaction on social media blamed describing the violence as a fight between communities on racial grounds as “incitement”, claiming the violence was a result of taxi bosses fighting.
