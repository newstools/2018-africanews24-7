JOHANNESBURG, May 18 – The ruling African National Congress is stronger and will win 2019 general elections, President Cyril Ramaphosa told party supporters in Tembisa, Ekurhuleni on Friday. “The ANC is back … it’s strong, it’s powerful. The ANC will win 2019 elections. The ANC campaign has started, those who have doubts about ANC doing well must catch a wake-up,” Ramaphosa told residents at Tswelopele informal settlement. He added that the governing party needed dedicated volunteers to help it win the hearts of voters. Ramaphosa addressed supporters after an early morning health walk in the township. He is due to give a keynote address at the official launch of the party’s “Thuma Mina” campaign. The campaign is a preparation for next year’s elections and will focus on the party listening and actively resolving people’s problems, especially those around the poor delivery of basic services such as water, sanitation, and housing. As Ramaphosa spoke, a shack caught fire in the background. Residents hurried to the shack to extinguish the blazing fire. Ramaphosa and the rest of the ANC leadership left the informal settlement after he finished speaking to move to the next stop. – African News Agency (ANA)
