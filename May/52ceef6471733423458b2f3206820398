JOHANNESBURG, May 9 – The African National Congress (ANC) North West provincial executive committee (PEC) meeting to discuss the resignation of Premier Supra Mahumapelo continues at Embassy House in Mahikeng on Wednesday. The PEC convened an urgent meeting following Mahumapelo’s announcement that he would resign as the North West premier on Wednesday. Mahumapelo seemed to have somersaulted on his intention to resign stating that his structure called him to consult with the provincial executive committee because he did not consult the PEC. “I will expect all of us to be patient and wait for the discussion of the provincial committee,” he said, adding that something was not right in the ANC. Mahumapelo said he believed that there was a political conspiracy against him, saying he would inform the ANC of the political conspiracy when the time was right. A group of Mahumapelo’s supporters sang at the meeting venue, chanting “no Supra no election”, threatening not to vote for the ANC in the coming national elections. Mahumapelo told the crowd to remain calm and allow the PEC meeting to continue as there were some decisions that needed to be taken. This was after his supporters threatened to storm into the meeting. Mahumapelo is also the provincial chairperson of the ANC North West. On Tuesday, he announced that he would resign as a premier by Wednesday at midday. Earlier, supporters of North West premier Supra Mahumapelo gathered in Mahikeng on Wednesday, chanting “No Supra, no election”.
