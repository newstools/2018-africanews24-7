Zodidi Mhlana JOHANNESBURG- South African organizations have joined international groupings in condemning the killing of 58 Palestinians including children by Israel forces describing Israel actions as a “massacre”. Israel soldiers used live ammunition and tear gas against Palestinians protesters who were demonstrating against the opening of the US embassy in Jerusalem on Monday. Palestine solidarity movement BDS South Africa (Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions against Israel in South Africa) welcomed South Africa’s government decision to withdraw its Israel ambassador following the violence. BDS SA said that Israel’s actions of using live ammunition on unarmed protesters should not be justified. The organization said that at least 90 Palestinians had been killed by Israel soldiers since the beginning of April. It called on the government to expel Israel ambassador immediately. “What we are witnessing Israel doing to the Palestinians is like the massacres against and killings of our people during apartheid,” BDS SA. Cosatu spokesperson Sizwe Pamla said the killing of innocent civilians was brutal. “The ruthless massacre of innocent children, women, and ordinary Palestinians in Gaza represents the continuation of the colonial, apartheid and racist policy of occupation against the Palestinians. The genocidal attacks by the Israeli defense force in Gaza and the simultaneous recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, are a gross violation of International law and the intensification of the occupation,” he said. Pamla called on several regional bodies such as BRICS and G77 to isolate Israel. @ZodidiMhlana
