JOHANNESBURG, May 25 – Ghanaian Lawyer and Member of Parliament for Sekondi, Andrew Agyapa Mercer has described former President John Dramani Mahama’s intended return to contest the elections in 2020 as unconstitutional. According to him, any such move by Mahama could be fraught with legal challenges as the constitution is clear on his eligibility under this circumstance, Ghana Web reported on Friday. Mahama announced over the weekend his intention to run for Ghana’s presidency in the 2020 elections, despite the fact he will face strong competition from other contenders. But Mercer outlined how the former president’s intention to run again would be problematic in so far as he understood the 1992 constitution. “My understanding of Article 66 and 68 is that he’s barred from ever contesting the presidency again, but when you raise that conversation they are quick to say that you’re afraid of them but these are the express words of the constitution,” said Mercer ”The man left office as president, the constitution doesn’t say that when you leave office after one term or two terms you have a right to contest twice.” – African News Agency (ANA)
