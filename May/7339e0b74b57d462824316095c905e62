JOHANNESBURG, May 21 (ANA) – The Mokala National Park veterinary quarantine has been lifted after more than a year under quarantine South African National Parks (SANParks) said on Monday. The park had been placed under quarantine after a buffalo bull testing positive for Mycobacterium bovis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which cause animal and human tuberculosis. As a result, the park and the  SANParks Kimberley holding facility were placed under quarantine. SANParks Senior Veterinary Manager David Zimmermann said the lifting of the quarantine was welcome but “disease surveillance at Mokala will continue routinely”. Mokala holds a significant population of disease-free buffalo brought in from Kruger National Park’s disease-free breeding project. “This is a very valuable resource in terms of genetics and conservation value and therefore strict biosecurity is maintained,” states Zimmerman. “After an intensive investigation and no further confirmation of disease, it is suspected that the initial positive results may have been as a result of sample contamination or a cross-reaction with an unidentified, non-pathogenic mycobacterium.”
