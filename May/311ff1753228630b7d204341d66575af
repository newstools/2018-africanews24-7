Zodidi Mhlana JOHANNESBURG- The Ekurhuleni Metro Police Department (EMPD) on Tuesday said that they have launched an investigation after a huge undisclosed amount of money was found in Langaville in Ekurhuleni. Wilfred Kgasago, spokesperson for Ekurhuleni Metro Police (EMP) said that investigation would assist in establishing whether the cash is linked to numerous recent cash-in-transit heists that have occurred mostly in Gauteng. Police are still searching for groups of men who were involved in robberies that took place in South Dale and Jabulani Mall in Gauteng on Sunday and Monday respectively. “At this stage, we don’t know whether the money discovered is linked to these robberies we have seen lately. The investigation will assist in uncovering that,” Kgasago said. He said that the money was confiscated after a tip-off was received from a reliable source. Kgasago said that four people including three females have since been arrested after the amount of cash was discovered at two places on the East Rand. Kgasago said EMP officials were told by owners of the house that the money was being kept for an SBV guard. SBV has since distanced itself from the discovery saying none of its employees were involved in this. “We’re aware of a tweet that implicates a SBV employee in a recent heist. Authorities have confirmed that this is not a SBV employee. Investigations are still underway. We’re committed to working with authorities to apprehend criminals involved in,” the company said on Twitter. There has been a surge of cash-in-transit heists in South Africa, with a total of 135 robberies having occurred since January this year alone. Crime activist Yusuf Abramjee this week said that heists have skyrocketed by 100% over the past year in the country. Some robberies have occurred in the North West and Limpopo over the last two days. @Mhlana
