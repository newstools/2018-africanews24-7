Captain Simphiwe Mhlongo said the trio were arrested in pre-dawn raid by the Political Task Team with the assistance of the National Intervention Unit (NIU) after the team intercepted information of a plot to allegedly assassinate the Municipal Speaker. “The Mayor, a Councillor and a hit man allegedly planned an assassination plot against the Speaker who is alleged to be an obstacle in the awarding of a tender. It is understood the speaker allegedly suspected undue influence and possible corruption in the process,” said Mhlongo.
