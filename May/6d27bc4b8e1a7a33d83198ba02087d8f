JOHANNESBURG, May 9 – The government of Kenya, with the support of the World Bank, has launched a $1 billion project to help alleviate poverty in the north and north-eastern regions of Kenya where nearly 70 percent of residents live in poverty and have poor access to basic services. The project called the North and Northeastern Development Initiative (NEDI) plans to increase investments in transformative and integrated infrastructure and sustainable livelihoods to the region. In these regions of Kenya poverty is exacerbated by frequent droughts which pose a significant threat to livestock, the main source of food and income for nearly all of the people who live in this area. Socio-economic indicators fall significantly below the national average; for example, the female literacy rate is 41 percent, well below the national average of 89 percent. Its success will depend largely on strong collaboration between the stakeholders: the two levels of government, the private sector, civil society organisations and development partners. “The people living in the region are among the poorest in the country,” said Diarietou Gaye, World Bank country director for Kenya. “This calls for more investments in the region, much more than we have done in the past.” NEDI will be spearheaded by both the national and county governments and will benefit 10 counties – Garissa, Isiolo, Lamu, Mandera, Marsabit, Samburu, Tana River, Turkana, Wajir and West Pokot. It has six new projects in energy, road transport, water and sanitation, agriculture, social protection, and a programme that will support communities hosting refugees. – African News Agency (ANA)
