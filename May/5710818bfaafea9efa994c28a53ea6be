JOHANNESBURG, May 4 – Hair products company Mizani, a division of L’Oréal USA, has launched its first brand campaign in South Africa, which was shot with a “dream team” of local talent in the lively hipster Maboneng neighborhood of Johannesburg. Mizani worldwide general manager Shane Wolf said the brand – which in Swahili means balance – followed its roots. Wolf said the up-and-coming enclave of Maboneng had served as a fitting location as Africa continues to inspire beauty, art, and style, creating trends embraced across the globe. “Our inspiration comes from the dynamic African market where women are using their hair as the ultimate form of self-expression, changing their styles on average six times per year,“ said Wolf. Wolf said the brand assembled a dream team of local talent and invested in local businesses to produce the shoot for their brand visuals and lifestyle content. Local Mizani Artists Jawad Maphoto,Ayanda Madlebe, Titus Magida, Sonnyboy Magano and Johnny Tshauke, led by Artistic Lead, Pekela Riley, tailored a unique series of hair looks that were brought to life by the creative forces of photographer Ross Garrett, wardrobe stylist Papama Mtwisha, and makeup artist Alex Botha, supported by Faith Seuoe. “There was an amazing sense of joy and pride felt amongst the global and local teams for this project,” said Erica Roberson, Vice President of Mizani Global Marketing. “It was so powerful to look around and see the emerging talent coming directly from the Johannesburg community, from the talented hair artists, photographers, to makeup and wardrobe stylists.” -African News Agency (ANA)
