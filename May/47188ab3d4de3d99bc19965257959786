JOHANNESBURG, May 25 – Emotions ran high when grieving family, friends and work colleagues held a memorial service for Dr. Ndyeboyesizwe Julius Nondonga at Eshowe Hospital in KwaZulu-Natal on Thursday. The 29-year-old doctor died last week when his vehicle crashed head-on with a truck on the uThukela bridge – between Mandeni and KwaDukuza on the N2 highway. Speaking at the memorial, KwaZulu-Natal Health MEC Dr. Sibongiseni Dhlomo said: “Here at eShowe Hospital we mourn another tragic loss of a young man Dr. Ndyeboyesizwe Julius Nondonga”. Before he took up a position at eShowe Hospital, Nondonga worked at the Prince Mshiyeni Memorial Hospital. “Even though he comes from the Eastern Cape, he spent all his time and his life in KwaZulu-Natal, and for that, we are greatly humbled,” said Dhlomo. “When we lose doctors who are this young we feel the pain because we still had expected him to contribute for many more decades. The pain that we feel as the department, however, cannot be equated to the pain of his family. Because for them he was a son, a child who grew up with them and who realized his dream and became a doctor.” Dlhomo also said Nondonga was “a symbol of breaking the chain of poverty in his family … we send our deepest condolences to the family”. CEO of Eshowe Hospital Mr. Nhlanhla Sangweni said Nondonga was one of the best doctors at the hospital’s Obstetrics and Gynaecology unit. “He was always prepared to lend a hand, he was respectful. He was a hard-working doctor and he was friendly to the patients.” Nondonga leaves behind his parents, three siblings, a fiancé and a young son. He will be laid to rest at uMthatha, Elangeni AA section on Saturday. – African News Agency (ANA)
