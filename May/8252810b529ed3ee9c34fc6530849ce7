CAPE TOWN, May 23 – South African national police commissioner General Khehla Sithole on Wednesday told MPs that there were strategies which had been put in place to prioritize police safety at all stations, although he admitted that there were challenges. He said some of the police stations needed to be completely redesigned as they made police members vulnerable. However, some police station premises were being rented which become a barrier to raising safety measures at those particular stations. Sithole was briefing the parliamentary committee on police on the Engcobo police station killings earlier this year in which five police officers and a retired soldier were gunned down. He was also giving an update on the technology strategy with special reference to CCTVs for police stations and also on the situation at Mamelodi West police station in which police officers earlier this month allegedly mishandled a case of a missing child, Katlego Joja, 10, whose body was found days later after her parents had been turned away after reporting her missing to the station. -African News Agency (ANA)
