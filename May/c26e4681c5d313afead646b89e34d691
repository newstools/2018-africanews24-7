JOHANNESBURG, May 15 – The Premier Soccer League on Tuesday confirmed the Premiership promotion/relegation matches will go ahead as scheduled. This comes after Ajax Cape Town had been relegated from the Premiership after being docked points for fielding ineligible player Tendai Ndoro, the SA Football Association announced earlier on Tuesday. As a result of the ruling, the revised log positions of the Premiership see Ajax finish bottom, and Platinum Stars finish one spot ahead in 15th. Stars will, therefore, participate in the promotion/relegation play-offs on the dates originally planned. The scheduled fixture in Thohoyandou on Wednesday between Black Leopards and (now) Platinum Stars will still go ahead at 3 pm. Ajax Cape Town were fined a total of R 350 000.00. Ndoro was sentenced to a two-match suspension for his misconduct. The player was in breach of the Fifa rule which states a player may not appear for more than two clubs in a season. The Zimbabwean striker played one game for Orlando Pirates in August, before signing and playing for Saudi Arabian side Al Faisaly. Signing for Ajax in December, Ndoro played seven games for the Cape side. Ajax, though, can still appeal the ruling with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). – African News Agency (ANA)
