 JOHANNESBURG- With more than 30 mine workers having been killed in the mining industry since the start of the year, trade unions say that mine owners should be held liable for the deaths of mine workers.  Scores of Cosatu and NUM members on Thursday picketed outside the offices of the Chamber of Mines in Joburg expressing concern about the increase in the number of mining fatalities.  Responding to the concerns raised, Chamber of Mines representative Jeanette Hosfayer said that it was also worried about the fatalities. The Chamber said it was committed to zero deaths and wanted to “arrest the spike in deaths.”
