Staff Reporter JOHANNESBURG- All operations at Rivonia On Deck Restaurant in Sandton have been suspended after South African Revenue Service (SARS) officials pounced on the facility this morning. The restaurant manager, Lerato Kholoanyane said the raid today was related to a tax dispute the business had with SARS. “We hope to resolve the matter in the next few days so that operations can begin as soon as possible,” Kholoanyane said. She apologized to the clients “for any inconvenience caused”. @Africanews24-7
