He said the NEC had noted the report of the Officials that the President had agreed in principle to resign and had proposed time frames extending from three to six months. “While appreciating President Zuma’s proposal, the NEC noted that South Africa is going through a period of uncertainty and anxiety as a result of the unresolved matter of transition. Further that this uncertainty and anxiety will erode the renewed hope and confidence among South Africans since the 54th National Conference of the ANC,” said Magashule. “Sensitive of the need to handle this matter with dignity, the NEC once again sent a delegation to brief the President Jacob Zuma about the need to shorten the timeframes so that this matter is speedily resolved. The NEC received feedback from the delegation that the President of the Republic did not accede to a shorter time frame the NEC, therefore, decided to recall its deployee, Comrade Jacob Zuma, in accordance with Rule 12.2.21.2 of the ANC Constitution, which accords the NEC the authority to “recall any public representative”. Magashule said there should be continuing interaction between the officials of the ANC and the President of the Republic. He said the decision by the NEC to recall its deployee was taken only after exhaustive discussion on the impact such a recall would have on the country, the ANC and the functioning of government. “The decision of the NEC  provides certainty to the people of South Africa at a time when the economic and social challenges facing the country require an urgent and resolute response by all sections of society. It is critical that South Africans are united around the task of growth, job creation and economic transformation,” he said. Magashule said the decision will be communicated publicly and through appropriate forums to all structures of the ANC, Alliance Structures and all the Mass Democratic Formations. @karabongoepe1
