JOHANNESBURG, February 26 – The Nigerian air force has deployed additional air assets to the north-east of the country to help search for 110 schoolgirls missing after an attack on their school by suspected members of Islamist militant group Boko Haram, Reuters reported. The move followed confirmation from Nigerian authorities that 110 girls, out of a total of 906 students from a school in the town of Dapchi, in Yobe state, remained unaccounted for following last Monday’s attack by the insurgents on the school. The mass abduction is the largest since 270 schoolgirls were kidnapped from Chibok in 2014. Some of the girls managed to escape, others were released following negotiations while some remain missing with reports that a number have married their captors and given birth to children fathered by the kidnappers. Boko Haram has killed more than 20,000 people, and forced two million to flee their homes since they launched their insurgency in 2009 in a bid to establish an Islamic state in Nigeria’s north-east. – African News Agency (ANA)
