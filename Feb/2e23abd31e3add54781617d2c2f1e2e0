JOHANNESBURG, February 23 – Kaizer Chiefs’ Colombian striker Leonardo Castro says that though there is always pressure on the Glamour Boys to win, it is far more intense in South America or Europe. Ahead of the game against Bloemfontein Celtic at the FNB Stadium on Saturday (start 8.15pm) Castro talked about the possibility of Chiefs winning the league title. “I understand the hunger of our supporters for trophies. However, it’s too early to talk about the championship title. We take it one game at a time and every game is important.” With the gap between Absa Premiership log leaders Mamelodi Sundowns having shrunk to just five points, Saturday’s match is going to be vital. Asked about the pressure of playing for Chiefs and challenging for the league title, the Colombian striker responds with a smile: “Pressure is playing in South America or in Europe. “That’s tough and you need to be mentally strong. Of course, there is pressure here as well, but not at that level. I love to play soccer – that’s not pressure, it’s what I do for fun.” Castro scored a magnificent goal on debut for Amakhosi against Baroka FC on January 21. The striker netted the second goal in the 2-1 win. It was his first game for the club since joining from Mamelodi Sundowns during the recent transfer window. “I really wanted to score in that game,” the Colombian reflects, “especially as I hadn’t scored for a long time. I was happy to help Chiefs get the three points in my first game.” He has been partnering Moon up-front in the last two matches, beating Golden Arrows (3-0) and Cape Town City (1-0), playing a vital role in these wins. Chiefs are presently in the second position on the Absa Premiership log, having collected 34 points from 21 games, while Bloemfontein Celtic are down in 12th spot with 25 points from 20 matches. “We are looking for the win on Saturday,” the striker points out, “we want to make the Amakhosi family proud.” – African News Agency (ANA)
