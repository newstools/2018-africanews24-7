Zodidi Mhlana JOHANNESBURG- The South African Human Rights Commission on Wednesday confirmed that it received a complaint regarding threats and intimidation directed at the screenings of Inxeba (The Wound). Several movie houses in the Western Cape and the Eastern Cape cancelled the screening of the film during the weekend after people opposed to it threatened to boycott the movie.
The contentious movie portrays initiation, which is a rite of passage into manhood and touches on homosexuality. SAHRC spokesperson, Gail Smith said: “The film has sparked much controversy arising from allegations that it violates the sanctity of cultural practises, which by their nature are secret, others lead to the form of portrayal of practise. Objectors to the film indicate that the content not only flouts cultural norms and practise but is an inaccurate portrayal of initiation practise.” She called on those not happy with the release of the film to protest against it not to use violence. “The Commission thus calls on all who feel aggrieved by Inxeba: The Wound to exercise their right to protest within the confines of the law, and to engage more constructively about the concerns to ensure that while the protests demonstrate an objection, the act of protest remains lawful and in accordance with the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. The Commission would thus like to urge those who are protesting against the film, and those who support it, to be mindful of the fact that disputes over constitutionally enshrined rights – the right to freedom of expression and the right to dignity of cultural, religious, and linguistic communities – should be ventilated in a peaceful manner,” Smith said. @Mhlana
