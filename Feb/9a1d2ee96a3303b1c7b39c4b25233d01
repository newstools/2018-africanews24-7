JOHANNESBURG, Februrary 1(ANA) – Bullion producer DRDGOLD said on Thursday it expected headline earnings per share of 14.06 to 14.54 cents  in the six months to December 2017, compared with a loss of 2.4 cents for the previous corresponding period. It attributed the increase to an 11 percent increase in gold produced despite a 4 percent decrease in the rand gold price received. “We are planning gold production from our operations of 147,000 to 153,000 ounces at cash operating costs of approximately R475,000 per kilogram for the year ending 30 June 2018,” the company said in a trading statement. – African News Agency (ANA),
