HARARE, February 14 – Main Zimbabwe opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai has died. He was 65. Top MDC-T sources confirmed Wednesday night that Tsvangirai had lost his battle to cancer of the colon at a hospital in Johannesburg. Since 2000, Tsvangirai had always posed a strong challenge to former Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe. In 2008, he beat Mugabe at the polls, but reportedly failed to garner enough votes to see him in office. An election rerun saw a brutal and bloody campaign of violence which left around 400 people either maimed or dead and saw Mugabe hold onto power. – African News Agency (ANA)
