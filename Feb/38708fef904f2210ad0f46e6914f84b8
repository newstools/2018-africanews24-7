WITBANK, February 27 – Mpumalanga member of the executive council (MEC) for human settlements Speedy Mashilo on Tuesday said there were too many shacks in Witbank and other areas of the province that were occupied by people who were frequently committing a crime. “There are too many shacks that are occupied by men. You find a man staying in a shack alone. These men commit a crime,” said Mashilo while addressing a crowd of people estimated to be over 2000 outside the Witbank Magistrate’s Court. This was shortly after a 32-year-old traditional healer appeared for a formal bail application in connection with the kidnap and murder of a 14-year-old girl with albinism, Gabisile Shabane, and a 15-month-old boy Nkosikhona Ngwenya. The children were kidnapped from their home in Hlalanikahle on January 28, allegedly by three men who entered their home after breaking a window. The body of one child was discovered in Cullinan in the east of Pretoria and another was found on the side of the N4 highway early last week, said Mpumalanga provincial police spokesman Brigadier Leonard Hlathi. Mashilo said his department would make a plan about the shacks. Lawyer Zamo Sibisi, for the traditional healer, asked the court to give his client more time to prepare for the bail application. The court granted the request and postponed the matter to March 6. A crowd of people gathered at the exit of the court and called on the police to hand the traditional healer over to them. Police had to fire rubber bullets to disperse the crowd which resulted in a stampede. Late on Tuesday evening, Hlathi said the calm has been restored, adding that the only injury reported to the police was about an elderly woman who sustained a broken arm during the fracas. “No arrests have been made and we are ready for any eventuality,” said Hlathi. – African News Agency (ANA)
