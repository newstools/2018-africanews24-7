CAPE TOWN, February 22 (ANA) – Western Cape Premier Helen Zille is set to deliver her State of the Province Address in the provincial legislature on Thursday. The Premier is  expected to focus on the devastating drought which has affected Cape Town and other areas of the Western Cape and which has led to the implementation of severe water restrictions and the possibility of Day Zero when the city’s taps run dry. In February, the City of Cape Town implemented Level 6B restrictions limiting residents to 50 litres of water per person per day. The City of Cape Town on Tuesday announced that water saving efforts by residents had led to Day Zero being further moved to July 9 from June 4. On Wednesday, finance minister Malusi Gigaba announced in his budget speech that R6-billion has been set aside for drought relief in the Western Cape and other parts of South Africa. – African News Agency (ANA)
