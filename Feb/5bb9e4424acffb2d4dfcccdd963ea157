JOHANNESBURG, February 12 (ANA) – The Democratic Alliance (DA) in the Western Cape has called on “all parents, caregivers and all relevant stakeholders” to look out for any signs that may help them prevent suicide among the vulnerable. The DA call coincides with “Teen Suicide Prevention week” which begins Monday and ends on Sunday. The South African Anxiety and Depression Group reports that nationally, 1-in-4 teenagers have attempted suicide. “Teen Suicide Prevention Week affords us the opportunity to intensify awareness with the objective of ensuring that our children are not susceptible to self-harm,” explained Lorraine Botha, DA member of the provincial Parliament and Standing Committee Chairperson on Health and Social Development in the  Western Cape. “I commend the Western Cape Minister of Health, Nomafrench Mbombo and her Department for the mental health infrastructure and constant awareness campaigns that they are driving in the Metropole. “I do however call on Minister Mbombo and her department to further expand these campaigns and facilities to the province’s rural communities. Incidents of suicide, such as that of 10-year old Mcneal Madonza in Lambertsbay who tragically died having played the rope-around-the-neck choke game, can be prevented.” Botha said she will visit Mcneal’s family to extend her condolences. “Furthermore, I want to discourage people from playing these dangerous games. I have already addressed the youth at Engelbrecht Primary School in Elandsbay promoting mental health awareness and reminding our young people that there is help readily available for them. “I would like to encourage teenagers to talk to a family member, local counsellors, or organisations such as the South African Anxiety and Depression Group, to get assistance, should they have suicidal thoughts.” – African News Agency (ANA)
