Johannesburg – The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has called on the Kenyan government to obey a court order suspending a broadcasting ban on four privately-owned television stations. This week, the high court ordered the government to lift the ban on Citizen TV, Inooro TV, NTV, and KTN News for 14 days while a case challenging its legality was heard, according to reports. The order came two days after authorities switched off transmitters while the stations were broadcasting live coverage of an event by the opposition in the capital Nairobi, according to reports, the CPJ said in a statement. Separately, a court ordered police to halt attempts to arrest at least three Nation Media Group (NMG) journalists, according to an online report in the Daily Nation, which is owned by NMG, one of the outlets affected by the ban. The journalists – Linus Kaikai, Larry Madowo, and Ken Mijungu – said they believed police planned to arrest them and applied to the court for anticipatory bail, which was set at 100,000 Kenyan shillings (US983) each, reports said. All three were due to report to police headquarters in Nairobi for questioning on February 5, according to reports. Kenya’s interior minister said in an earlier press conference that authorities were investigating individuals and organisations, including media houses, in relation to the Nairobi event. “The Kenyan government’s refusal to abide by the court order and permit four television outlets back on air is not only contempt for the rule of law, but a brazen example of censorship,” said Angela Quintal, CPJ’s Africa program co-ordinator. “Every day that these TV stations are kept off air and their journalists are harassed or intimidated further erodes Kenya’s position as a leader of press freedom in Africa,” she said.
