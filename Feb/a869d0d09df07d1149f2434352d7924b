JOHANNESBURG, February 2 – The SA Football Association (Safa) region of ZF Mgcuwa in Upington, Northern Cape will host a referees fitness test on Saturday, February 24 at Mxolisi Dickey Jacobs Stadium. Fifa insists on each federation conducting regular fitness tests to measure the physical ability of match officials which in turn improves the quality of refereeing. Passing the fitness test is the minimum requirement from SAFA for referees to be deployed to officiating matches and therefore having these tests is an  important part of their program. “These are regular tests are conducted by the association to ensure that officiating at all levels is at the highest quality. We are looking forward to another year of producing more referees while at the same time ensuring that we maintain the highest quality of officiating across all levels of South African football,” said Safa’s technical committee chairperson,Natasha Tsichlas. – African News Agency (ANA)
