JOHANNESBURG, February 22 (ANA) –  The Premier Soccer League (PSL) on Thursday requested Cape Town City coach Benni McCarthy to explain comments he made on November 26 directed at match officials. The PSL has given McCarthy five days to respond. McCarthy had harsh words for the match officials following the 2-2 draw between his side and Golden Arrows at the Princess Magogo Stadium in November last year. “You want my honest opinion? It’s bad refereeing, that’s what’s causing us to draw,” McCarthy said after the game. “Why must I shy away when the referee can tell a player to **** off and you must say the referees are good? That’s what’s causing the problem. “And as a coach and players you must be so frustrated standing on the side and seeing it happening week in and week out. “Every game is the same thing and you as coaches must just keep quiet because if you don’t you are going to get fined [or] suspended. “That’s what’s causing the draws because you don’t have the best officials.”
