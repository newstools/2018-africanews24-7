JOHANNESBURG, February 6 (ANA) –  The African National Congress Women’s League (ANCWL) says it is “saddened by video images of a group of men wearing #Siyavuma t-shirts brutally assaulting women” outside the party’s headquarters, Luthuli House, on Monday. The woman was part of Black First Land First (BLF) protesters hauled out of a bakkie and attacked by ANC members claiming they were acting in defence of their “revolutionary house”. A video of the vicious attack in which a man is seen kicking a woman twice in the stomach as she lay on the ground has gone viral. “The ANCWL has noted reports that one person who participated in the assault is the Mr Thabiso Setona the ANC branch secretary zone 12 in Greater Johannesburg region,” said the womens’ league statement released hours after the attack. BLF members had intended to protest outside the ANC headquarters and handover a memorandum demanding that beleaguered President Jacob Zuma serve out his term, which ends next year. They did eventually hand over their memorandum after a few skirmishes. The group “defending” the ANC wants Zuma recalled and the new party president, Cyril Ramaphosa who was elected in December to take over. The ANC will again meet over the matter of Zuma’s exit on Wednesday. “There is no justification to subject any person to physical violence and dehumanising acts in the name of politics. It is a barbaric act and those who participated in that stupid primitive act must face the law,” said the ANCWL in their statement issued by Secretary-General Meokgo Matuba. “Setona must reveal all his gang members who participated in the violent attack of defenseless women outside of Chief Luthuli House. All of them must face the full might of the law.” The ANCWL also request legal institutions to assist the women, “who were assaulted by Setona’s gang” to lay civil claims against people who organised the event. The suspect has since handed himself to the police. – African News Agency (ANA)
