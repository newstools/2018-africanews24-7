Zodidi Mhlana JOHANNESBURG- The African National Congress (ANC) in greater Johannesburg on Monday afternoon condemned its member who was filmed repeatedly kicking a woman during a march outside Luthuli house. ANC’s regional spokesperson, Jolidee Matongo said that the party’s branch secretary in Inner City, in Zone 12, Thabiso Setona will be disciplined for his actions. “Thabiso Setona’s acts do not represent what the African National Congress stands for, and as a consequence of his revolting behavior, he will face a disciplinary process hastily.The African National Congress Greater Johannesburg Region has noted with dismay and utter disgust the images and videos circulating of Thabiso Setona, ANC Branch Secretary in Inner City, Zone 12, assaulting a woman outside Luthuli House this afternoon,” he said. Matongo said that the Regional Executive Committee of the party will be meeting with Setona on Monday evening. “We will be hearing from him. He has been suspended until the disciplinary process is completed. He is not available on his cell phone, but we will be meeting with him. He said that the party was against any form of violence.  As the ANC in Joburg we strongly condemn any acts of violence against any person, more so women. The ANC Greater Joburg does not subscribe to the notion of people violently assaulting those who hold contrasting political views,” Matongo said. A small group of Black First Land First members was met by sticks, fists and kicks as they bakkie arrived outside Luthuli House, the ANC’s headquarters in Johannesburg today. A video of Setona kicking and assaulting a woman has been widely circulated.  Is this what it has come to?? Kicking and hitting women in the defence of a corrupt individual?? #LuthuliHouse #HandsOffZuma The man kicking the lady is
