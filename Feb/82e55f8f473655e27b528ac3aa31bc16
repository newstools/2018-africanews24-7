Karabo Ngoepe JOHANNESBURG- Public Service and Administration Minister Faith Muthambi is attending a summit in Dubai and not meeting with the Gupta family, her office said on Sunday. “Minister Faith Muthambi, will today, Sunday, 11 February 2018, participate in the 6th edition of the World Government Summit that will be held in Dubai,” said spokesperson Joe Makhafola. This was in response to social media speculation that Muthambi and Energy minister David Mahlobo were in Dubai.  “I just landed in Dubai off EK762. Name boards for Faith Muthambi & David Mahlobo at the door,” she tweeted. The post was followed by numerous comments questioning their presence in the city, with some believing they were there to meet the controversial Gupta family. Makhafola said Muthambi had been invited by the UAE Minister of State for Happiness and vice president, Ohood Al Roumi. Mahlobo was on the other hand attending a summit in Egypt. Mahlobo’s spokeswoman Nomvula Khalo said he was in Egypt at an oil and gas summit. There are pictures of Mahlobo with Tarek El Molla, Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources of the Arab Republic of Egypt and  Ambassdor Vusi Mavimbela. The pair was also said to be strengthening bilateral cooperation in Cairo. Mahlobo was also set to meet President El Sis on the Exhibition and later participate in the Ministerial Panel as a speaker. The summit will run from February 12 to February 14. @karabongoepe1
