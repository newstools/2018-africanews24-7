JOHANNESBURG, February 15 – The tables have been turned with reports that one of a group of suspected poachers, partly responsible for decimating South Africa’s wildlife on an annual basis, has been killed by a pride of lions, AP reported. Managers of the Umbabat Private Nature Reserve, near the Kruger National Park, reported that the man was killed last week with footprints from two other people nearby suggesting that two other poachers escaped. Tracks indicated that the other poachers had beat a hasty retreat, leaving a heavy calibre firearm and ammunition behind after the death of the poacher last Friday. The rhino population of the Umbabat reserve has been heavily targeted by poachers over the last few years. Umbabat managers say they implement costly security measures in an effort to thwart poachers who regularly target rhino, elephant, lions, hyenas, pangolins and vultures in the private reserve. – African News Agency (ANA)
