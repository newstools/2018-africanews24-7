JOHANNESBURG, February 12 (ANA) – League strugglers Platinum Stars can go all the way in the Nedbank Cup according to coach Roger de Sa. Platinum Stars occupy bottom spot on the Premiership table, but De Sa says there is no reason why his troops can’t be successful in the cup competition. Stars host Baroka FC in their Nedbank Cup last 32 clash at Royal Bafokeng Stadium on Wednesday. “Cups can turn your season around. We are going to give couple of players rest but our priority is to win the game,” said De SA. “We are definitely going to give it our best shot. Baroka made a name for themselves in this competition. Remember they knocked Kaizer Chiefs out some years ago. It’s a competition that they really enjoy. We know it’s going to be a difficult one. We want to go as far as we can. Our priority is to win against everyone we come across,” said De Sa.  With the Nedbank Cup, some regulars will pave way for other players as De Sa is set to ring a few changes to his team. De Sa wants his men to maintain the momentum that saw them stage an impressive comeback when Dikwena played to a 3-3 draw against Chippa United in their last league outing. “It gives us an opportunity to try out two or three players. It’s a game that there’s not much pressure compared to the league. We will try out a few combinations with a couple of players. “It’s important that we keep the rhythm going and from our last game against Chippa, our performance was okay and we want to keep that going. We don’t want to make too many changes but we know there are players that need a rest to recover a bit and there are players that need to be tested out and be given an opportunity. “We also need to keep the new ones active and give them an opportunity. It’s a bit of a juggle and hopefully we can make the right choices,” said De Sa. – African News Agency (ANA)
