HARARE, February 17 (ANA) – University of Zimbabwe vice-chancellor Levi Nyagura has been arrested over former First Lady Grace Mugabe’s doctoral degree. Nyagura was picked up late Friday by officials from the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (Zacc). Zacc spokesperson Phyllis Chikundura confirmed Nyagura’s arrest, saying he would be detained overnight and possibly taken to court Saturday on a charge of abuse of public office. The higher learning institution only made public Mugabe’s degree this year, four years after she was conferred the degree after a record three months research period. She graduated at the same time as former Zimbabwe vice-president Joice Mujuru in September 2014, with Mugabe being conferred with a Doctorate in Philosophy from the Faculty of Social Studies, which was chaired by Claude Mararike then. On the day, 3,274 graduates were capped. Nyagura has been in the spotlight since Grace was capped by her husband, former President Robert Mugabe, who was chancellor of all State universities in the country. Recently, 15 lecturers from the Sociology Department at UZ petitioned Zacc to investigate the issue, claiming they never saw Grace Mugabe’s study transcripts and progress report of her thesis. However, Nyagura accused the lecturers of being under-qualified to have monitored her academic progress. – African News Agency (ANA)
