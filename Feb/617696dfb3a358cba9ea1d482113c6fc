He said try they would beat everyone of their members if they tried to come close to Luthuli House. “What just happened now was a demonstration of how angry we are and the pain we are feeling. We are saying we don’t want anything to do with Zuma around here. Anyone who will stop us from that calling is provoking the ANC. We will deal with them. BLF, we are giving you a strong warning, don’t even come here. You can do your stockvel somewhere else but not here (Luthuli House). @karabongoepe1
