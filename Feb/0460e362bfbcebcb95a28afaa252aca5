PRETORIA (ANA) – A confident-looking President Jacob Zuma walked into the press room at the Union Buildings in Pretori late on Wednesday night to address local and international journalists in what will be recorded as his last address as president of South Africa. Giggling as he was ushered to the podium, Zuma delivered an emotional speech, narrating how he felt betrayed by his comrades in Africa’s oldest liberation movement, the African National Congress (ANC). As the highly anticipated press briefing started, journalists who had stood up as Zuma walked in, took their seats but with a thousand questions on their faces. “Good evening? You do not respond to my greetings? You are tired? Why? We are working?” Zuma started off, followed by his charismatic and instantly recognisable giggle. The drawn out speech touched on the motion of no confidence, which was to be debated in the National Assembly on Thursday had Zuma not bowed out. “Fellow South Africans, I address you after weeks of speculation about my future as President of the Republic of South Africa. In particular, I make reference to the much publicised and awaited decision of the African National Congress issued on February 13. It is now public knowledge that the national executive committee of the ANC resolved to recall me as president of the Republic,” Zuma read his prepared speech. “I have also learnt that before I respond to the initial decision, a new decision has been made by the ANC, whose effect is that I have now been compelled to resign by way of a motion of no confidence set down for tomorrow, 15 February.” “I have therefore come to the decision to resign as president of the republic with immediate effect,” Zuma said in a televised address. “Even though I disagree with the decision of the leadership of my organisation, I have always been a disciplined member of the ANC.” – African News Agency (ANA)
