CAPE TOWN, February 21 – The South African National Civic Organisation (Sanco) on Wednesday expressed shock at the murder of five police officers and an off-duty soldier at Ngcobo police station near Queenstown in the Eastern Cape. The organization said that a manhunt for those responsible must be intensified. “No stone must be left unturned until the heartless criminals whom we suspect are highly trained individuals are behind bars,” said Sanco spokesperson Jabu Mahlangu, conveying condolences to families and colleagues of those who were killed in the attack which took place in the early hours of Wednesday morning. Mahlangu also wished five other police officers who were injured in the attack a speedy recovery. According to the police, unknown suspects entered the police station in the early hours of Wednesday morning and without warning, randomly opened fire on the members on duty. “Three members were killed instantly in the community service center. A retired soldier was also shot dead as the suspects were fleeing,” police spokesperson Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo said. “The suspects made off with a police van, taking two other members. The bodies of both these members with gunshot wounds were later found along the roadside, six kilometers from the police station.” – African News Agency (ANA)
