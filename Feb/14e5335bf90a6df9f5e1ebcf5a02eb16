JOHANNESBURG, February 16 – Eskom’s head of generation Matshela Koko, who was suspended earlier this month over allegations of graft, has submitted his resignation, the power utility confirmed on Friday. Eskom spokesperson Khulu Phase confirmed that Koko had submitted a resignation letter but the power utility was still in discussion over whether to accept it. “I can confirm that Eskom has received a letter of resignation from Mr. Koko stating that he wants to leave Eskom with immediate effect. The status of his resignation is currently with the disciplinary hearing which has gone on recess but will decide now after 12 pm,” Phasiwe said over the phone. A copy of Koko’s resignation letter, posted on Twitter by one news outlet, said he was, however, not admitting to guilt over charges relating to the awarding of contracts to a company in which his stepdaughter owns shares. Koko had recently gone to the Labour Court to try to interdict Eskom from firing him after it preferred new charges against him. Last month, Koko told the Parliamentary portfolio committee that he would not resign from Eskom after almost 30 years with the power utility, saying that “my blood is Eskom blue”. – African News Agency (ANA)
