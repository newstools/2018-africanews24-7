JOHANNESBURG, February 13 – South Africa’s National Union of Mineworkers said on Tuesday another worker had died at Sibanye-Stillwater’s Driefontein mine on Monday night, less than a week after a fall of rocks at its Kloof Mine killed two people. The union said the miner died at Driefontein’s No.1 shaft as he tried to blast the ore pass box that was blocked by big rocks. When the rock crushed he was pushed by mud rush which suffocated him to death. ““We are very much concerned about the loss of lives happening at Sibanye Stillwater,” said Mbuyiseli Hibana, NUM Carletonville regional secretary. “The company must be made to account on all of these incidents and those found responsible must be made to take the blame.” – African News Agency (ANA)
