JOHANNESBURG, February 9 – The South African Police Service (SAPS) have arrested a businessman for attempting to bribe a City official in Fordsburg after he was found to have “bridged prepaid electricity meters and bypassed a water meter”. Mayor Herman Mashaba on Friday said: “It is alleged that on Thursday during a Buya Mthetho operation in Fordsburg, officials were shocked to find four bridged prepaid electricity meters and a bypassed water meter. “As the officials were about to remove the meters, the suspect, who is the owner of the property, approached the team leader from the revenue department and offered him R10,000 in exchange for new meters,” Mashaba said. He said a sting operation, led the City’s Group Forensic and Investigation Service working with SAPS, City Power and the revenue department, was then set up in the evening. The team proceeded to the property with the requested electricity meters where the suspect was nabbed. The suspect is expected to appear in the Johannesburg Magistrate’s court on Friday. – African News Agency (ANA)
