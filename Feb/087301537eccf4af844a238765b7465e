JOHANNESBURG, February 16 – Arguments in the protest from Orlando Pirates and Polokwane City against Ajax Cape Town for including Tendai Ndoro in the club’s team were heard by the Premier Soccer League (PSL) disciplinary committee (DC) on Thursday. A judgement is expected but without a timeframe given by the PSL DC. The issue is that Ndoro was included in the Ajax team despite Fifa ruling that a player cannot play for more than two clubs in a season. Ndoro played a match for Pirates in August before transferring to Saudi Arabian club Al Faisaly. Ndoro, 32, was then signed by Ajax in December. The PSL DC ruled in late January that Ndoro was not eligible to play for AJax. Subsequently, the PSL appealed that decision, which then went to the SA Football Association for arbitration. The Zimbabwean international was then included in Ajax’s 3-0 league win over Pirates in Cape Town on January 31, before the 1-1 Premiership draw with Polokwane City in Polokwane on February 4. – African News Agency (ANA)
