JOHANNESBURG, February 26 (ANA) – The United Nations mission in South Sudan says it has recalled a 46-member peacekeeping police unit after some members allegedly paid local women living in a protection camp for sex. A UN statement says the Ghanaian policemen have been recalled from Wau to the capital, Juba. UN’s chief in South Sudan, David Shearer, labelled the behaviour a clear breach of their code of conduct, which prohibits sexual relationships with vulnerable people. Michael Makuei, a spokesman for the South Sudan government said that those responsible for committing the acts should not be allowed in the country. The United Nations has 17,000 peacekeepers in civil war-torn South Sudan. Allegations of sexual misconduct against UN peacekeepers over the years have plagued the international organisation which vowed to clean up the act of its forces. – African News Agency (ANA)
