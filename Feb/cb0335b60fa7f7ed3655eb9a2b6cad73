 Karabo Ngoepe  JOHANNESBURG – Speaker of Parliament Baleka Mbete on Monday said she was consulting over the request by Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema to push forward the motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma to 13 February.  Spokesperson Moloto Mothapo said Mbete has written to Malema.  “In the letter to Mr Malema and the attorneys of the EFF, Ms Mbete said she was currently consulting on the request to reschedule the motion and would revert after this. The Rules of the National Assembly entailed consultation with relevant structures, including the Chief Whip of the Majority Party and the Leader of Government Business,” said Mothapo.  “Ms Mbete originally scheduled the motion for 22 February. This was after consulting with the Chief Whip of the Majority Party and the Leader of Government Business and obtaining confirmation for the 22 February scheduling from the National Assembly Programme Committee.”  Mothapo further dismissed rumours that Mbete had turned down the request. Malema’s request comes as the opposition parties call for the dissolution of Parliament on Monday.  “Reports that the Speaker had rejected the EFF’s request to schedule the Motion of No Confidence on 13 February are, therefore, false,” he said.  Zuma’s role as the head of state has been under the spotlight with his own party pushing for his removal.  ANC members have been locked in a special National Executive Committee meeting in Irene in a final bid to have Zuma step down.  @Karabongoepe1  karabo.ngoepe@18.202.123.161
