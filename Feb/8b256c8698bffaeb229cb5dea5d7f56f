Africa News 24-7 reporter Floyd Mayweather has gone down as one of, if not the, best defensive boxers in history. Manny Pacquiao, even though he fought Mayweather long after his best and carrying an injury, was long touted as Mr Speed. Speed is a trait that has been admired since the first day mankind put on boxing gloves. The man who landed more shots on Mayweather in 10 rounds than the greats managed in 12, Conor McGregor – not a boxer by any stretch of the imagination – famously said before one of his MMA fights: Speed beats power, but precision beats speed. So then, what happens when speed meets precision? Meet 19-year-old undefeated prospect Ryan Garcia. This kid is next level when it comes to speed. With a record that reads 13 fights, 13 wins, and 12 knockouts, he is bound to attract attention. This super-featherweight American, from California and clearly with Mexican decent, has the world of social media in a buzz. Not merely because of his training videos – he is trained in his garage by his family – but because of the manner of his knockouts. He lands right hooks, with his hands back up in guard position before the opponent even registers that a punch was thrown. Here, have a look at him training:  So there you have it. Today we speak about Canelo and GGG, we speak about Lomachenko and Terence Crawford. We speak about Errol Spence, Mikey Garcia and Kovalev. You can thank us today for introducing you to Ryan Garcia as he will be on that list by the time he is 25.
