JOHANNESBURG, February 22 – Optimum Coal Mine, owned by the controversial Gupta family, have commenced with business rescue proceedings, South Africa’s power utility Eskom said on Thursday. Eskom said the mine, that supplies Hendrina Power Station in Mpumalanga, informed them of the proceedings on February 19. “Eskom has fully complied with its contractual obligations to Optimum Colliery. In January 2018, Optimum Coal Mine failed to meet its contractual deliveries to Hendrina Power Station. This has led to Eskom imposing a failure to supply penalty. The penalty amount exceeded the invoice amount from Optimum coal mine,” Eskom said in a statement. “Coal has not been delivered to Eskom since workers at the mine downed their tools yesterday, 22 February 2018. In mitigation, Eskom has diverted coal from other mines to supply Hendrina Power Station. Eskom will continue to focus on the energy availability of the rest of the fleet to ensure the reliability of supply.” Earlier on Thursday, news channel eNCA reported that the chief executive of Optimum Coal Mine was expected to address striking workers over the future of the company and payment of their salaries. About 2,000 workers affiliated to the National Union of Mineworkers went on strike at the at the mine in Mpumalanga province on Wednesday, demanding to know if the company would be sold and whether they would be paid this week.
