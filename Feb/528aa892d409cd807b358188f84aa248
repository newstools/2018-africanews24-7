PRETORIA, February 18 (ANA) – A City of Tshwane Metro Police Department (TMPD) officer has been shot dead in his home – the second officer to die this week, the TMPD said on Saturday. The 29-year-old constable was found by his colleague in a pool of blood with a bullet wound at his flat in the Hercules area in Pretoria at about 11am on Saturday, the TMPD said in a statement posted on the Arrive Alive website. “The constable was supposed to report for duty today [Saturday] but he did not show up. His colleagues made numerous phone calls trying to get hold of him to no avail. One colleague who stays in the same complex with him decided to go check up on him and that is when he made the gruesome discovery. “He found the constable’s lifeless body in a pool of blood with his service pistol lying next to him.” An inquest docket had been opened by the South African Police Service (SAPS) for further investigation, and the possibilities of a suicide had not been ruled out. “We appeal to members of the community who might have any information regarding this incident to contact the nearest SAPS or TMPD at 012-358-7095/6 or 012-358-2124. The constable was known as a hard worker who was passionate about his work. He was stationed at a drug unit under the crime prevention section at the time of his death. “The Tshwane metro police is still in disbelief as his death comes at a day when the department is burying another constable who was killed during a business robbery in the past week. TMPD would like to send deeply felt condolences to his family, colleagues, and friends,” the statement said.
