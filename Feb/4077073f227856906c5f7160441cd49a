JOHANNESBURG, February 1 – The Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court on Thursday postponed the case against three men accused of hijacking buildings. Jonathan Constable, Bongani Kathide and Kingsley Eze face charges of fraud related to two properties south of Johannesburg. The men are accused of approaching unsuspecting tenants living in the buildings and introducing themselves as investigators. They allegedly claimed the owners of the properties were hijackers and that the tenants should not cooperate with them, but rather pay their rent to the three of them instead. Due to outstanding information, the state requested a postponement to February 22. At their previous appearance, Magistrate Lucas Van Schyff denied them bail and said he had reasons to believe that they would continue their “dodgy dealings” if they were released. Defence advocate Dumisani Mabunda did not oppose the postponement. – African News Agency (ANA)
