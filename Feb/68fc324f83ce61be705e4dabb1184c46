Karabo Ngoepe JOHANNESBURG- Members of uMkhonto we Sizwe Military Veterans Association (MKMVA) have accused ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa of having an agenda against President Jacob Zuma for many years. The group which addressed the media on Tuesday said Ramaphosa’s witch hunt started in 1991 when he became Secretary General if the ANC and removed Zuma as head of intelligence. “When you look at CODESA, the first thing he did when he became the Secretary General was to remove Thabo Mbeki as lead negotiator and removed Zuma as head of intelligence,” said Sibusiso Radebe. “He has been after Zuma for a very long time.” The statement comes as the party is trying to push out Zuma as president of the country. Since his victory at the December conference, speculation has been rife that Zuma would not finish his term and there have been a series of talks to facilitate his exit. Radebe said Ramaphosa’s move are the work of White Monopoly Capital, who parachuted him to the position of Secretary General in 1990. “We are going to deny him an opportunity to fulfil their agenda of White Monopoly Capital,” he said. Radebe called on all other freedom fighters to stand up and defend the country from being given to WMC. He said they would take up arms if necessary to defend the revolution. “We laid down our arms but if we are pushed then we will review that position. If they shoot us then we will retaliate,” he said. @karabongoepe1
