Zodidi Mhlana JOHANNESBURG- The Thabo Mbeki Foundation on Thursday refuted claims that the former president was serving as an advisor to ANC’s president Cyril Ramaphosa. In a statement, the Foundation said that reports of Mbeki serving as an advisor were aimed at “misinforming and misleading” members of the public. This week, Citizen newspaper reported that Mbeki was “working closely with Ramaphosa to save South Africa.” “President Mbeki has stated that the Leadership of the ANC must be given an opportunity to deal with the issues that they themselves have raised such as fighting corruption, the renewal of the ANC, the Unity of the ANC etc. He urged instead that the Leadership must look seriously on the ANC Veterans Declaration of November 2017, which pointed to a number of these problems and how they should be resolved,” The Foundation said in a statement. The Foundation said that the phenomenon of fake news was concerning saying members of the public should be educated about its dangerous. “It is a matter of grave concern that this journalist would peddle a story which has no basis in reality. Our concern is not only just that this is a propagation of fake news but we are highly conscious of the implications and the consequences of the propagation of fake news. The general public, in South Africa should be alerted to the dangers of this phenomenon. The peddling of lies and misinformation must be exposed and condemned in the strongest terms possible because people may take decisions and act on the basis of these lies,” the statement said. @Mhlana
