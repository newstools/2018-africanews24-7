The department handed over 20 new vehicles, including ten passenger vehicles and 10 bakkies which will be utilised to cover rough terrain. The vehicles were all marked and branded in provincial traffic logos, colours and stripes. “All districts received five vehicles and LVDs comes handy for stations that are servicing villages, townships and small dorpies. These vehicles are supposed to be utilised to increase traffic officer’s visibility, ascertain free flow of traffic and to ensure safety in the urban and rural areas of Bokone Bophirima. “This is a deliberate drive meant to mitigate recent accident reports that show a spike in accidents involving stray and wild animals especially along rural and farming areas.
