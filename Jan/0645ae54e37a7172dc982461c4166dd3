It’s the second train accident in less than a week. On Thursday a Shosholoza train coming from Port Elizabeth heading to Johannesburg collided with a truck in Kroonstad. About 18 people were killed and over 200 left injured. The train caught fire after derailing. It is alleged that the truck driver crossed the railway line without stopping, causing the crash. The death toll in the accident remained a subject of speculation since its occurrence due to the condition of the bodies of the victims. The Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) has established a 24-hour line – 011-544 9623 – that families could call to inquire about their loved ones who were on board the train from Port Elizabeth to Johannesburg on January 4. @karabongoepe1
