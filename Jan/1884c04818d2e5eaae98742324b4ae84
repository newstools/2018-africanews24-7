JOHANNESBURG, Jan 17 (ANA) – A Roman Catholic priest is in custody after being arrested by Kenyan police for sodomising a man, AP reported. Police said Tuesday that villagers in Muranga County in central Kenya had been monitoring the priest whom they suspected of being gay and alerted local authorities when an 18-year-old man went into the priest’s quarters on Monday. Police said they found the two in the priest’s bedroom and after interrogation they admitted to sexual relations. Homosexuality is illegal in many parts of Africa with gays facing severe harassment, physical threats and judicial punishment. Sodomy is banned Kenya while neighbouring Uganda passed legislation penalising some gay acts with life imprisonment – but the country’s constitutional court ruled that the law was invalid on procedural grounds. – African News Agency (ANA)
