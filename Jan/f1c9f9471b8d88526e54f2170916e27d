London (dpa) – Ryan Giggs was appointed manager of the Wales national
team on Monday. The Manchester United great receives a four-year contract to replace
Chris Coleman, who stepped down in November to take charge of English
Championship side Sunderland. “I am so proud to have been given the honour of managing the national
team,” Giggs, 44, said on the Football Association of Wales website. “The challenges that we have ahead of us with the Nations League and
qualification for UEFA EURO 2020 excite me a great deal. “I can’t wait to start working with the players as we prepare for
those crucial games later in the year.” Giggs played 64 times for Wales between 1991 and 2007 but never
appeared at an international tournament. His only previous managerial experience came as caretaker boss at
United for the final four games of the 2013-14 season after David
Moyes was sacked. Giggs then spent the following two campaigns as Louis van Gaal’s
assistant before leaving when Jose Mourinho was hired in the summer
of 2016. He interviewed for the Swansea job later that year but lost out to
Bob Bradley. Coleman spent six years in charge of Wales and led them to a surprise
semi-final appearance at Euro 2016, their first major tournament
since 1958. Wales, however, failed to qualify for this summers World Cup in
Russia after finishing third in their group behind Serbia and
Ireland.
