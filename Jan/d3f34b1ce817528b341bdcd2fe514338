London – Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho said Thursday
his commitment to the club is total, dismissing rumours he wants to
leave as “garbage.” “I say garbage, I don’t find a better word than to define the talk,”
he told his weekly press conference. “The worst thing someone can do is put one inch of doubt into my
professionalism, to every detail related to my job, so yes the
garbage news affected me just on this aspect because it’s something I
don’t admit.” Mourinho is halfway through a three-year contract and said he is
already thinking beyond the end of that deal. “I repeat I am in the middle of my contract, if I am going to sign a
new one it depends on the club but my commitment is total and I want
to stay,” he said. “I see myself here (after three years), is just a question of the
club, the board the owners…(if) they are all happy with my
contribution and they want me to stay beyond the end of this
contract.” -(dpa)
