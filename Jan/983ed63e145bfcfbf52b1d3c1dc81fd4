JOHANNESBURG, January 29 (ANA) – Troubled state power utility Eskom is due to release its delayed 2017 interim results on Tuesday. Ratings agency Moody’s downgraded the utility’s credit rating on Friday, saying it reflected the deterioration in Eskom’s financial and liquidity position with no prospect of a near term equity injection by the government to shore up its weak financial profile. – African News Agency (ANA),
