JOHANNESBURG, January 18 – Retail firm Dis-Chem said on Thursday approximately 760 employees had gone on strike over unpaid bonuses at its Midrand distribution centre and head office but trading and operations at its 131 stores were not affected. The company said the workers comprised less than six percent of its workforce and were affiliated to the National Union of Public Service and Allied Workers (NUPSAW). “Their dispute relates primarily to union organisational rights as well as disagreement on decisions relating to discretionary bonus payments to a portion of its members,” it said. “Dis-Chem has initiated discussions with the affected employees in an effort to arrive at a common understanding of certain issues and agree on a suitable resolution.” Last Friday, NUPSAW, an affiliate of the South African Federation of Trade Unions, said it was  preparing for a strike at Dis-Chem Pharmacies across the country over the recognition of its organisational rights. It said Dis-Chem had refused to grant it organisational rights in terms of section 21 of the Labour Relations Act and had also “inflicted excruciating pain” to its members over their annual bonuses in December 2017. – African News Agency (ANA)
