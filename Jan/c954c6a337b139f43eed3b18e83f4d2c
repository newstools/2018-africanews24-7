Zodidi Mhlana JOHANNESBURG- With a large number of people drowning in debt in South Africa, the National Credit Regulator (NCR) has appealed to consumers to be cautious before signing any form of credit agreements. The NCR’s CEO Nomsa Motshegare said that it was important for consumers to understand and scrutinise any credit information in their possession before signing agreements. “Regardless of the reason for borrowing, before consumers sign credit agreements, they need to understand the cost of credit and the terms and conditions of different credit agreements,” she said. Motshegare said that it was crucial that credit providers provide borrowers with a pre-agreement statement and quotation when requesting credit. She said that this will enable consumers to understand costs associated with the credit arrangement. Motshegare said that consumers should providers with accurate information when applying for credit as this would assist in preventing indebtedness. “However, as a consumer you can negotiate the interest when you get the pre-agreement statement and quotation. You can use these to shop around for better deals. Consumers are reminded to only borrow from a registered credit provider,” Motshegare said. Credit providers are also obliged to conduct an affordability assessment before extending credit to consumers according to the National Credit Act (NCA). The affordability assessment was introduced in a bid to reduce the number of people with high levels of indebtedness. More than 9 million consumers in South Africa have impaired credit records. Some consumers have been forced to rely on short term loans to make ends meet as battle to meet their financial obligation. @Mhlana
