JOHANNESBURG, January 30 – An entrepreneur from KwaZulu-Natal province is developing a mobile power harvester aimed at extending the battery life of mobile devices such as cell phones and tablets. Simangaliso Austin Zungu is the founder of Sengwayo Group KwaMbonambi near Richards Bay and his invention came second out of 198 entries at the recent ‘Inkunz’isematholeni Youth in Business’ awards. The programme is run by Ithala Development Finance Corporation and aims to help young people with innovative and sustainable business concepts become established entrepreneurs. Zungu’s PoEX Module is designed to be built into cell phones and tablets for continuous harvested and eco-friendly power on-the-go. The devices can be charged without having to connect to a power source or portable power banks. “Since high school, my passion and interests were already navigated – either I enrol for a BTech in clinical technology or become an entrepreneur in the technology and innovation space,” said the 34-year-old father of two, who has been working on the PoEX Module concept for the last two years. “The project costs about R2.5 million for product development, IP protection and marketing. This is where Ithala and programme partners, Technology Innovation Agency and Invotech stepped in to assist,” he said. Zungu hopes to join forces with major cell phone and tablet manufacturers  if his project succeeds, and help create jobs. – African News Agency (ANA)
