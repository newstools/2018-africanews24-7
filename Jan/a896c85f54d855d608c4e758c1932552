Rio de Janeiro – Former Brazilian star Ronaldinho has retired
from football, some three years after his last game, his brother and
agent said late Tuesday. “He has stopped, it is ended,” Roberto de Assis Moreira was quoted as
saying by Brazilian media. Ronaldinho, 37, last played for Brazilian
club Fluminense in 2015. The attacking midfielder Ronaldinho is known as one of the most
creative players of his generation and was twice world footballer of
the year. He won the Champions League with Barcelona in 2006 along
with two Spanish titles and was a Serie A winner with AC Milan in
2011. And in 2002 he lifted the World Cup with Brazil following a 2-0 win
over Germany in the final. “Camp Nou’s ever-smiling magician,” Barca tweeted in tribute while
AC Milan hailed: “the man who enchanted San Siro and every football
fan.” A significant farewell, touring the world, is now planned. “We will do various events in Brazil, Europe and Asia and, of course,
we are arranging something with the Brazilian team as well,” his
brother said. -(dpa)
