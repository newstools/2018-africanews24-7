Zodidi Mhlana JOHANNESBURG- The Independent Examinations Board on Wednesday announced that the IEB 2017 matric pass rate is 98.76%, compared to last year’s pass rate of 98.67%. In 2017, 11 464 full-time and 666 part-time candidates from 212 examination venues throughout  Southern Africa wrote the IEB National Senior Certificate (NSC) examinations in October and November. An increase in the number of pupils who sat for the 2017 examinations was recorded. The IEB said that all “candidates who passed achieved a pass that is good enough to enter tertiary study at one of the three levels:” •88.50% of the cohort achieved entry to degree study, compared to 87.61% in 2016 •8.96% qualified for entry to diploma study, compared to 9.83% in 2016 •1.30% achieved entry for study at the higher certificate level, compared to 1.23% in 2016. The Board said that Umalusi declared the results fair and valid after observing the examinations process. Anne Oberholzer, CEO of the IEB applauded learners’ dedication and commitment over the years. “The 2017 NSC candidates have done very well and have once again shown that with a commitment to hard work over their 12 years of schooling, and supported by a dedicated cohort of teachers and parents, they have passed with flying colours. They are ready for the next step in their journey of life-long learning,” she said. Oberholzer said that pupils performance in Advanced Programme Mathematics which consisted of 1 424 learners from IEB schools and 1749 learners in state schools, was “pleasing with 92.72% achieving a pass above 40%, compared to 87.9% in 2016.” According to the IEB, the Advanced Programme courses are extension courses which are benchmarked by UK NARIC and considered equivalent to the UK A-levels. Oberholzer said that the education system must be able to respond to all technological advancement currently unfolding to ensure that no one is left behind. “The advances in technology have already enabled alternate learning spaces – blended learning, online study. These in turn have exposed the need for the development of new cognitive competencies. Globalisation and the integration of societies across traditional boundaries demand that citizens develop appropriate social and emotional skills to manage a variety of non-traditional relationships effectively,” Oberholzer said. She said young people who are not keen on university education should also be given space to explore other existing opportunities. The Board said that the closing date for the application for re-marking is January 10 this year , while the closing date for pupils who qualify for supplementary examination is February 12 2018. @Mhlana
