Zodidi Mhlana JOHANNESBURG- Backing from her passionate teachers and parents played critical role in Janke Van Dyk’s exceptional matric achievement. “My parents were really supportive, my dad especially helped me to plan for the exams, and he was behind everything that I did at school. My teachers at school were passionate and inspired me to really work hard,” says Van Dyk. Basic Education minister Angie Motshekga on Tuesday honoured Janke Van Dyk for being a top achiever in Quintile 5. The 18 year-old from Bellville High School in the northern suburbs of Cape Town says working hard also helped her to succeed. “Hard work, determination, good planning especially when exams come around and you don’t have much time for all the subjects to set up a study roster,” she said. She said that she did not expect the results. “I felt really surprised when they called my name, it’s a great honour and I really did not expect it. I knew that I did well throughout the year, but I did not expect to be honoured at this level,” Van Dyk said. She will be heading to Stellenbosch University to study Chemical engineering this year. Her advice to this year’s Grade 12 pupils is: “Ï would say that they have to work very hard from the start, make sure that they fully master their work before going into exams and if they don’t understand anything, ask teachers because they are there for that reason,” Van Dyk added. @Mhlana
