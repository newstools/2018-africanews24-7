JOHANNESBURG, January 22 – The South African Music Awards (SAMA) on Monday announced that entries for this year will be closing next week on Wednesday, 31 January. SAMA Chief Executive Officer Nhlanhla Sibisi said: “It’s only 10 days to go and the SAMA24 excitement will be kicking in full gear as the judging process begins. We encourage the industry to take this last minute opportunity to send through their entries to be considered for a SAMA award”. “It was a busy year and the industry showed a lot of growth, so we anticipate a fiercely competitive instalment of the awards.” Sibisi said the submission of entries that has been open for the past three months was the first step towards the 24th edition of the SAMAs. This will be followed by a vigorous verification process leading to the judging by a selected panel of industry experts and peers before the nominees are made public. – African News Agency (ANA)
