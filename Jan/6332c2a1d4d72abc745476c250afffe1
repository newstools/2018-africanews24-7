CAPE TOWN, January 24 (ANA) – The Cape Town Water Crisis Coalition will hold a protest gathering on Sunday to voice their anger at the city’s mismanagement of its water shortage that could result in the South African city being the first in the world to run dry. Cape Town last week drastically cut water restrictions again from 87 litres per person per day to 50 litres — about two-and-a-half standard buckets — as it continues to struggle with a three-year-long drought due to a lack of rains that traditionally filled catchment areas. The protest will take on Sunday at 2.30pm outside the Cape Town Civic Centre but the Coalition has called on all supporters to form human chains under the slogan “Water is Life” in their own communities. — African News Agency
