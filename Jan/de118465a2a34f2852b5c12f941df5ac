JOHANNESBURG, January 16 – The R24 freeway westbound has been temporarily closed just after the Van Riebeeck road off-ramp on top of the N12 bridge leading towards Gillooly`s interchange because of a midnight oil spill, the Ekurhuleni Disaster and Emergency Management Services said on Tuesday. “This is because of slippery road surface that needs to be decontaminated and the removal of wreckage from the road as well,” said a statement from the disaster and emergency management services. At about midnight a multi-load articulated truck crashed into a concrete barrier, jack-knifed and ruptured its diesel tank before catching alight. Two crew members were hospitalised with serious, but stable injuries. Both were taken to Arwyp Hospital in Kempton Park. “Motorists are encouraged to use Van Riebeeck road off-ramp leading to N12 westbound freeway as an alternative route,” said the statement. – African News Agency (ANA)
