Karabo Ngoepe JOHANNESBURG- Embattled Gauteng head of Health Dr Barney Selebano has resigned with immediate effect from his position. The Gauteng Department of Health has confirmed his resignation. The department’s Lesemang Matuka declined to give further information on his resignation. “I can confirm that the department has received the resignation from the suspended head of the department Dr Barney Selebano,” said Matuka. Selebano was suspended from his position for his role in the Life Esidimeni tragedy where at least 140 mentally ill patients died. He oversaw the transfer of patients from Life Esidimeni to unregistered NGOs throughout the province. In December, Selebano testified at the Life Esidimeni arbitration hearings in Johannesburg where he apologised for what had happened. He said he took responsibility for the regrettable deaths. He said he did not foresee such a tragedy happening. He admitted that his department did not follow advice. He added that he took responsibility for what happened. “We did things wrong by not heeding to advice, by not listening to other people. I take accountability. It happened under my watch. There is no way that, if you are a leader and something happens, and then you suddenly want to walk away from it,” Selebano said. @karabongoepe1
