JOHANNESBURG, January 22 – Angry residents of Protea Glen in Soweto on Monday blocked roads with burning tyres and other objects in a protest over what they said was an unnecessary delay to repairs to their storm damaged homes. Weeks after Johannesburg City Mayor Herman Mashaba visited Protea Glen, Soweto, to inspect the storm damage and promised a probe into the quality of the construction of the houses, fed up residents took to the streets. Two people died during the storm in December, which also affected Bramfischerville, Snake Park, Lefureng, Fleurhof, Lenasia, Lawley and Kagiso. On Monday early morning traffic was disrupted along the N12 South and R559 in Johannesburg, when protesters marched to Bedfordview on the East Rand, where they handed over a memorandum to Cosmopolitan and Kiron properties, the companies that build the houses. Commenting on the matter, Mayor Mashaba’s spokesperson Luyanda Mfeka said:“For now the level of damages are still being assessed and once everything is done a statement will be issued”. Metro police said during the protest there were no reports of damage to property and no arrests were made. – African News Agency (ANA)
