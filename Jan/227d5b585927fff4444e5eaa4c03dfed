Ayanda Mdluli The Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) has warned that it will suspend Eskom’s bonds in the markets if the state owned entity does not release its interim results in the next two weeks. In a Securities Exchange News Service (SENS) announcement, the JSE said Eskom has failed to submit its interim report within the three month period stipulated in the JSEs debt listing requirements. It has since given the power utility three weeks to submit its interim results or face suspension. “Accordingly, this announcement is issued to warn holders of debt securities, if the issuer fails to submit its interim report on or before 31 January 2018, that the issuer’s debt securities and the issuer’s registration of the programme memorandum may be suspended in accordance with the provisions of the JSE’s Debt Listings Requirements,” said the JSE in a statement.
