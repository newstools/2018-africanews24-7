OHANNESBURG, January 16 – Miss Universe 2017 Demi-Leigh Nel-Peters returns to South Africa on Wednesday – two months after she was crowned in Las Vegas, Nevada, in the US. Nel-Peters made history on 26 November when she became the second South African to win the sought after and prestigious crown – the first being Margaret Gardiner, who won the pageant in 1978. As the 66th Miss Universe winner, Nel-Peters will embark on a week-long celebration that includes visits to Johannesburg, Cape Town and her hometown, Sedgefield. Ahead of her trip to South Africa, Nel-Peters said she was thrilled to be returning home. “I can’t begin to express my gratitude and how proud I am to represent our country as Miss Universe. Being a global ambassador is as much a responsibility as it is an honour,” said the 22-year-old. “Our nation is comprised of many different backgrounds and cultures, one of the many things that makes me immensely proud to be a South African. I am very excited to celebrate this achievement with my people in the spirit of Mzansi.” A statement from the organisers of Miss South Africa said: “Demi’s win has elevated national pride inspiring thousands of young people. We all have an extra spring in our step and smile a little broader when our fellow countrymen and women excel on the international stage”. “Demi’s homecoming is an opportunity for all South Africans to join in the celebrations and we couldn’t be prouder. Thank you to everyone for their continued support.” Nel-Peters will host “Unbreakable” workshops in Soweto, Johannesburg, and Cape Town with members of the community. She will also revisit victims of the Knysna fires who were beneficiaries of her fund-raising efforts for disaster relief in 2017. The Unbreakable campaign aims to educate, uplift and empower South African women.
