Karabo Ngoepe JOHANNESBURG- The African National Congress will implement free education in phases to ensure sustainability. This was revealed by party President Cyril Ramaphosa in his maiden January 8th Statement delivered in the Eastern Cape on Saturday. “This historic decision, which vindicates many decades of struggle for free education for the poor, will be implemented in a phased approach to ensure sustainability of government finances and radically expanded access to education,” said Ramaphosa. “This is a critical contribution to ensuring that students from poor backgrounds are able to access the kind of skills required for meaningful participation in the economy. This is giving effect to our objective of a skills revolution, which requires that we sustain our significant investment in basic education.” Ramaphosa said this would enable them to modernise the economy, improve the beneficiation of natural resources and prepare a workforce for the fourth industrial revolution. He added that the concentration of ownership of the economy in the hands of a white minority constrains sustainable growth and transformation. “We will work to change the ownership structure of our economy through, among other things, ensuring access to, and ownership of, financial institutions by black people, youth and women. This will include new approaches to regulation and licensing in the financial sector to foster diversified ownership and competition,” he said. @karabongoepe1
