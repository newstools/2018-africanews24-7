JOHANNESBURG, January 8 (ANA) – Gauteng Premier, David Makhura, visited the Emfuleni Municipality on Monday, following reports of water reduction in high lying areas over a period of four days, and said that the new mayor was mandated to improve the quality of life in the area. Makhura requested a briefing from Mayor, Lehana Khawe and his senior officials, his office said. Khawe acknowledged that there was a 40 percent reduction of water supply implemented by Rand Water and indicated that the Municipality had a payment agreement with Rand Water to cover the current and historic debt. Makhura’s office said that Khawe committed to oversee the discipline of the bulk payment and would also look at issues of consequences management where necessary. “We have brought in a new Executive Mayor with the same expectation and mandate to improve the quality of life of residents in this community”, Makhura said in a statement. Makhura also engaged with Water and Sanitation Minister, Nomvula Mokonyane, on the matter between Rand Water and the Emfuleni Municipality. Makhura was reassured that water would be restored in affected areas by Tuesday, his office said. Makhura advised the municipal leadership to find a lasting solution to mitigate the current basic service disruptions. “Having assessed the situation , I am of the view that the Municipal Council should consider a model where Rand Water takes over the function of water supply as well as infrastructure rehabilitation for a period of time due to their capabilities and technical expertise,” he said. – African News Agency (ANA)
