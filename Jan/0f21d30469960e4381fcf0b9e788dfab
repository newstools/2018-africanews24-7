JOHANNESBURG, January 15 (ANA) – SuperSport United on Monday announced the transfer of striker Jeremy Brockie to neighbours Mamelodi Sundowns. In a statement released by SuperSport United, CEO Stanley Matthews said: “It’s never easy to lose a key player like Jeremy, especially off the back of three great seasons with us in which we made five cup finals and he became the second highest scorer at the club. “We also understand that at his age this is Jeremy’s last big move and an opportunity to secure his financial future. “Given that he has made a significant contribution to the club on and off the field, our board have agreed to sanction his move to Mamelodi Sundowns and we wish him well in his future.” – African News Agency (ANA),
