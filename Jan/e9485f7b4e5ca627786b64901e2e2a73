London – US President Donald Trump said he “would apologize,” if requested, for re-tweeting links to anti-Muslim videos posted by the deputy leader of far-right group Britain First. Trump told celebrity television presenter Piers Morgan that he had not intended to endorse “racist people” by re-tweeting the links. “If you’re telling me they’re horrible people, horrible, racist people, I would certainly apologize if you’d like me to do that,” he told Morgan in an advance excerpt from an interview to be broadcast by ITV on Sunday. “I know nothing about them [Britain First],” Trump said in his first international television interview, recorded on Thursday on the side-lines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. “I don’t want to be involved with people [like that].” Morgan said Britain had granted state visits to Russian President Vladimir Putin, former Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe and Chinese President Xi Jinping. He told Trump that the implication by people who wanted to ban him from Britain was that “somehow you’re worse than they are.” “It’s just one of those things,” Trump said. “I don’t say anything because I don’t care,” he said, adding that he is a “tremendous supporter of the UK.” Trump announced earlier this month that he had cancelled a visit to London in late February, when mass protests against him were planned. But after he met British Prime Minister Theresa May in Davos on Thursday, both sides said they were “finalizing the details” of a visit this year. -(dpa)
