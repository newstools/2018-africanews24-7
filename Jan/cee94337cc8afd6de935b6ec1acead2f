JOHANNESBURG, January 31 (ANA) – The seventh PinkDay One Day International scheduled for  February 10 at one of South Africa’s most historic grounds, the Wanderers is set for another exciting contest. South Africa are yet to lose in pink and will look to retain their title against India in the fourth match of their six-ODI series. New Balance encourages cricket fans to #PitchUpInPink on the day to assist in raising awareness and funding for the fight against breast cancer. Every rand raised on the day will go to the Breast Care Clinic at the Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital, which sees up to 350 women with newly diagnosed breast cancer every year while treating more than 200, 000 patients on an annual basis.  David Miller, New Balance ambassador and SA batsman, said “PinkDay is an initiative that is very close to my heart. It is a chance for me and the team to express ourselves and show our support towards breast cancer awareness. We hope that everyone ‘pitches up in pink’ and that we can make this event a one to remember for years to come.” – African News Agency (ANA),
