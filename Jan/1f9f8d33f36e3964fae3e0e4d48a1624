Karabo Ngoepe Pretoria- Thousands of marchers have taken to the streets of Pretoria heading to mayor Solly Msimanga’s office. The marchers can be heard singing vulgar songs directed at Msimanga. EPWP workers claim Msimanga did not renew their contracts. Some claim they have been working since 2012 but today have been left in the cold. The marchers have been joined by African National Congress members. ANC Youth League regional chairperson Lesego Makhubele has been gunning support for the march. #TshwaneShutdown Marchers noe praying .@AfricaNews24_7 Gates to Tshwane house closed with police standing guard .@AfricaNews24_7 pic.twitter.com/CzsbZa1g2G — Karabo Ngoepe (@karabongoepe1) January 26, 2018  #TshwaneShutdown Placards at the march .@AfricaNews24_7 pic.twitter.com/gStRPip3am — Karabo Ngoepe (@karabongoepe1) January 26, 2018  Hawkers have been advised to pack away their merchandise as marchers approach.
