Staff Reporter Johannesburg- The Black First Land First (BLF) have announced that they were laying criminal charges against alleged cigarette smuggler Adriano Mazzotti at a Durban police station on Saturday.  BLF charged Mazzotti with tobacco trafficking, money laundering, fraud, corruption, bribery and tax evasions at the CR Swartz Police Station. According to the movement the charges are based mainly on the admission of guilt by Mazzotti in his sworn affidavit to the South African Revenue Service (SARS) on 6 May 2014, which he submitted in furtherance of settling the outstanding taxes of Carnilinx which amounted to R600 million. “It is shocking that both the SARS and the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) have done nothing to prosecute Mazzotti for his crimes”, said BLF in a statement. BLF said Mazzotti paid for Economic Freedom Fighters’ registration in the amount R200,000 to contest the 2014 elections. Controversial author exposes Malema  “The proceeds of crime were used to entertain EFF President Julius Malema, pay for the EFF to register for the  2014 elections, and also assist to pay Malema’s tax debt”. Malema has previously explained his relationship with Mazzotti and also admitted to SARS that Mazzotti did make a donation of R200 000 to the EFF prior to its registration. “We shall not rest until true justice is obtained against the white monopoly capital criminal”.
