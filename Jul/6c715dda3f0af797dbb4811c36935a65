JOHANNESBURG, July – The South African Football Association (Safa) will host meetings around the country with women’s provincial bodies in August. The purpose will be to hear what grievances club owners and other stakeholders are experiencing. Safa vice-president Ria Ledwaba will lead the delegation at these meetings to discuss the best way to take women’s football to the next level. “We have decided to host these meetings province by province because we want to hear what is happening at the ground level,” Ledwaba said. “These could be an administration issue, questions regarding players not being called up into our national team set-ups and so on. We want to know what they are experiencing so that we can come up with proper strategies and move forward.” The first provincial meeting will take place on August 13 at Zororo Lodge in Polokwane, before Ledwaba makes her way to other remaining eight provinces. The Safa vice-president also stated that she had full confidence that the highly-anticipated inaugural national women’s professional league will start by next year, should everything go according to plan. “We have been speaking to a whole lot of potential sponsors to join us in this massive project,” Ledwaba said. – African News Agency (ANA)
