Zodidi Mhlana JOHANNESBURG- A suspect has been killed and three others were injured during an attempted a cash-in-transit heist in Boksburg on Thursday morning. This occurred on North Rand and Atlas road in Boksburg just after 6 am. The attack happened not far from where two cash vans were bombed in May this year. ER24 said that when its paramedics arrived on the scene several people including security guards had been injured. “Paramedics found a woman seated in a taxi who sustained a gunshot wound. She was found to be in a serious condition. Paramedics also found two security guards who were injured. One of the security guards sustained a gunshot wound to the foot, and the other one sustained injuries to the foot. One of the alleged suspects was fatally wounded,” ER24 said. National police spokesperson, Vish Naidoo said that the police believed that the dead man died as a result of his own explosions. A security guard was shot in the hand. “One suspect was killed, we don’t know how he was killed because it does not look like he has any bullet wounds and we suspect that he was killed by his own explosions. He used an explosive device to open the door. It was a group of suspects, but the number is unclear,’ he said. No arrests have been made so far. Details concerning the heist are still sketchy. Concerns about increasing cash-in-transit heists have been expressed. At least 160 robberies have taken place since the start of the year. Two weeks ago, six suspects involved in another robbery in Hillbrow that claimed one police officer life and injured two people were nabbed. The suspects made off with an undisclosed amount of money. @Mhlana
