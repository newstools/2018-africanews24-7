PIETERMARITZBURG, July 27 – The high court in Pietermaritzburg on Friday postponed the corruption case against former president Jacob Zuma to November 30, while at the same time setting a November 16 deadline for his lawyers to file papers for his application for a permanent stay of prosecution. Zuma is in the dock alongside French arms manufacturer Thales on fraud, corruption, money laundering and racketeering charges. Outside court, where a large crowd had gathered in support of Zuma, a 24-year-old woman from Ulundi in far northern KwaZulu-Natal said she will continue supporting former president Zuma because she believes in his innocence. Nqobile Ntombela was one of the hundreds of people that flocked to Pietermaritzburg for Zuma’s court appearance on Friday. “He is our father, and as such we are here to support him. Zuma deserves peace in his life, the State should just drop the whole case against him.” She had arrived in Pietermaritzburg at 2 am, along with many of her friends, including Sibekezelo Mhlongo, to take part in a night vigil. The Freedom Square precinct in the Pietermaritzburg CBD was a sea of black, green and gold as African National Congress (ANC) members came out in their numbers to support Zuma. Member of Provincial Legislature, Reverend Vusi Dube, was among members of the clergy that led a prayer session outside the court. The mood outside was jovial as different artists, including members of Umkhonto we Sizwe Military Veterans Association (MKMVA) entertained the crowd. At one stage, Dube had to ask the volume from the speaker to be lowered as it was disturbing proceedings in court. Several leading figures, including ANC KZN chairperson Sihle Zikalala, eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede, and ANC KZN Treasurer Nomusa Dube- Ncube were in attendance to lend support to the former ANC president. – African News Agency (ANA)
