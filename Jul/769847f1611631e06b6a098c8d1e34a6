JOHANNESBURG, July 27 – Global leaders from Africa, Asia, South America, the Caribbean and the Middle East joined the BRICS Summit in Johannesburg on its last day on Friday to discuss how to strengthen relations and pursue inclusive economic growth. African leaders, including Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa, Angola’s João Lourenço, Rwanda’s Paul Kagame, Madagascar’s Hery Rajaonarimampianina and Botswana’s Mokgweetsi Masisi among others, as well as those from further afield such as Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and Argentina’s Mauricio Macri participated in the outreach session of the July 25-27 summit. “We have invited you today as leaders of some of the foremost regional formations of the global South representing all corners of the world including Asia, South America, the Caribbean, Africa and the Islamic Nations,” host, South Africa President Cyril Ramaphosa told the 27-odd leaders. “It is vital that all of us in the global south work together to address our pressing common concerns and needs.” Rwanda’s Kagame said the discussion was necessary, given the countries’ common interest in an open and fair international system. “Second, strengthening cooperation with BRICS contributes to medium and long-term human security and wider benefits especially employment for Africa’s young population,” he said. – African News Agency (ANA)
