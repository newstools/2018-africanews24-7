ZURICH (Reuters) – The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) dismissed former FIFA Secretary General Jerome Valcke’s appeal against his 10-year ban for breaching the world soccer body’s code of ethics. The court in Lausanne, Switzerland, said the ban and the 100,000 Swiss franc ($100,290) fine was “wholly appropriate,” and confirmed the decision made by FIFA’s Appeal Committee in 2016. Valcke, who was former FIFA president Sepp Blatter’s top aide, was found to be involved in the resale of FIFA World Cup tickets and other ethics violations, CAS said on Friday.
