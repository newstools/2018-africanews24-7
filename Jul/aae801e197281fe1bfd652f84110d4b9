JOHANNESBURG, July 23 – State-owned power company Eskom’s revenue levels remain inadequate and tariff increases awarded by the national regulator are not expected to improve the situation, group chief executive Phakamani Hadebe said on Monday. Hadebe, appointed at the start of the year to help stabilise the cash-strapped entity after several senior executives were implicated in corruption, however said the challenges facing Eskom were not insurmountable. “One of our biggest tasks is rooting out the corrupt behaviour of some of our own employees which has threatened Eskom’s financial viability, another real challenge that we are managing,” he said in a statement accompanying the company’s results for the year ended March 31. Despite satisfactory progress being maintained on Eskom’s new build programme, as well as solid operational performance for the current financial year, the company continued to face significant challenges in the short to medium term, he said. “Revenue levels remain unsatisfactory, and the 5.23 percent increase for the 2018/19 financial year further compounds the impact of the 2.2 percent tariff increase awarded in the 2017/18 financial year, and is therefore not expected to lead to much improvement,” he said. “Levels of arrear debt, especially from municipalities, remain unacceptably high,” Hadebe added, saying Eskom’s focus in the short term would remain on cost efficiencies to support financial sustainability. The utility was undertaking a strategy review, expected to be completed by September 2018, to ensure that it had an integrated strategy that addressed its current challenges and also ensured that future direction “is clear and focuses on stabilising the organisation by cleaning up governance issues and stopping the bleeding, and thereafter re-energising and growing the business”. Its turnaround plan included improving the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) margin to at least 35 percent by growing revenue and reducing costs, managing liquidity, including the recovery of arrear debt , investing in cost-plus mines to benefit from cheaper coal, restricting capital expenditure to R45 billion per year for at least the next three years and reducing reliance on debt financing through optimisation of the balance sheet.
