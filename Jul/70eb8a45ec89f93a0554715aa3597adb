CAPE TOWN, July 28 – The Commission of Inquiry into South Africa’s so-called state capture scandal, lead by Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, will start hearing evidence from August 20, the spokesman for the probe confirmed on Friday. “The deputy chief judge president confirmed today that the hearings will begin on August 20,” said Reverend Mbuyiselo Stemela. Stemela said the initial hearings into the how billions of rands were siphoned off the country’s state enterprises could run for between three to six weeks. “That will be published closer to the time.” The commission would publish the list of witnesses closer to the commencement date, he said. This week saw the granting of a court order extending the time frame of the probe from 180 days to two years, On Monday, the Pretoria High Court granted on order calling on interested parties to show reason why the period of its mandate should not be extended by 24 months from March 1, 208. The 180-day period  stemmed from the report and remedial action that flowed from former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela’s inquiry into state capture. Zondo had publicly stated constraints facing the commission, including financing and the need to obtain top security clearance for staff. (ANA)
