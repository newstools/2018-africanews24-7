Sello Theletsane JOHANNESBURG- The African National Congress in KwaZulu-Natal came out on Wednesday censuring an article that was carried out by the Business Day which they labelled as ‘falsehood’. The Business Day On Monday, 23rd July 2018, ran an article authored by two reporters Nce Mkhize and Chris Makhaye with a headline: “No more ANC support for Jacob Zuma, Sihle Zikalala vows”. According to the ANC KZN in their statement, the article is believed to have misquoted the newly elected ANC KZN chairperson, Sihle Zikalala, on the matter related to the support of former President Jacob Zuma on his court appearances. “It is deeply concerning that these days some journalists find it attractive to communicate falsehoods about the leadership of our movement. The actions of these reporters leave a bitter taste in the journalism profession as it became a norm for them to misrepresent facts on the ANC KwaZulu-Natal affairs,” said the provincial ANC in KZN. “The ANC continues to assert the inalienable right of all including former President, to be presumed innocent until proven guilty. We will continue to entertain the hope that the two journalists will one day respect the truth and avoid misleading readers,”. The movement further added that their decision to engage with the National Executive Committee cannot and does not mean that KwaZulu-Natal defined itself outside the overall discipline of the National Executive Committee. However, it is the task of all structures of the movement to engage with the national leadership on the implementation of decisions taken by the National Executive Committee, in case new challenges emerge. “We call on the Business Day to retract that article within the next seven days since its publication or else the ANC will refer the matter to Press Ombudsman to deal with the unethical behavior of their journalists and publication,” said the movement in a press release.
