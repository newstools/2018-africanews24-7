DURBAN, July 6 – There was singing and chanting of “rot in jail” outside the Verulam Family Court on Friday as the man accused of raping his stepdaughter 900 times over a five-year period was denied bail. Magistrate Irfan Khalil said that the man, who cannot be named to protect the identity of the child, had failed to prove exceptional circumstances as to why he should be released on bail. Exceptional circumstances have to be proven for those who are facing a schedule six offense. There was also a likelihood that the man would try to avoid trial and intimidate the girl, said Khalil. The state has charged the 43-year-old mechanic with rape, sexual grooming, exposure of a child to pornography and sexual assault. It is alleged that the child, who is now 10-years-old, had been raped since she was five-years-old. She is currently in a place of safety. The man has denied all of the allegations and said he intends to plead not guilty to the charges. The bail application played out over three-days this week, with the details of the alleged abuse being placed before the court. The state alleged that the man moved to Verulam – about 30km inland of Durban – from Johannesburg six months ago with the child. It is in Johannesburg that the child last attended school. Her biological parents are both dead. The case was brought to the police’s attention when the girl was beaten and chased out of the room she was sharing with her stepfather. She approached a neighbor and relayed the alleged abuse she had suffered. The accused will appear again in August via video link from Westville prison. – African News Agency (ANA)
