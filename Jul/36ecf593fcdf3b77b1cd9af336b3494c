CAPE TOWN, July 27 – Ajax Cape Town have given up their fight to play in the PSL this coming season and have accepted their fate which will condemn them to a life in the National First Division (NFD). It was a frustrated CEO CEO Ari Efstathiou who on Friday told a media briefing that he believed justice had not won the day. “Unfortunately time and legal procedure has trumped justice,” Efstathiou said. He was referring to the case where the club was docked points for fielding Zimbabwean Tendai Ndoro, which went against Fifa rules and thus impacted on PSL regulations. Efstathiou still maintains they did everything to follow the rules but admitted the process got complicated. He said Ajax had withdrawn their urgent application against the PSL to interdict the start of 2018/19 Absa Premiership season which is set to begin as scheduled on August 3/4. It’s a sad day for the Urban Warriors who are 51 percent owned by Dutch giants Ajax Amsterdam and have been responsible for producing many talented players though in recent years they have struggled to keep up with the ‘big guns’ in the PSL. – African News Agency (ANA)
