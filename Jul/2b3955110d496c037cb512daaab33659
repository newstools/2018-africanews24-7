CAPE TOWN, July 9 (ANA) – The first two of 12 schoolboys trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand have reportedly been brought out “alive and well” after divers executed a carefully constructed rescue mission, the MailOnline reported on Sunday. The exhausted pair, who were trapped underground for two weeks, were receiving treatment at the cave entrance before an ambulance drove them to an awaiting helicopter to fly them to hospital. The extraction team began the dangerous operation at 10am local time. All of the youngsters and their 25-year-old coach were expected to be out of the cave by late Sunday evening if everything went according to plan, the MailOnline reported.
