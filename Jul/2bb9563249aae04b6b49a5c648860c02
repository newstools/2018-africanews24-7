JOHANNESBURG, July 24 (ANA) – South African president Cyril Ramaphosa on Tuesday examined the state’s readiness for the 10th BRICS summit during a guided tour of the Sandton Convention Centre where it will be hosted. Heads of state from emerging economies Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa will attend the three day summit, starting on Wednesday. South Africa became a member of the Brics bloc in 2011. The ANC said earlier this week that its membership will help advance the country’s developmental goals and that government must ensure its chairing of BRICS in 2018 will be beneficial to South Africa and the entire continent. – African News Agency (ANA)
