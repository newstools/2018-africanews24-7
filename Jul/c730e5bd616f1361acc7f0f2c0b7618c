JOHANNESBURG – South African department store chain Woolworths Holdings Ltd is recalling a frozen savory rice mix following a worldwide product recall issued by the Hungarian Food Safety Agency due to an outbreak of listeria in Europe. More than a week ago, the Hungarian agency banned the marketing of all frozen vegetable and frozen mixed vegetable products made by the affected Hungarian plant and ordered their immediate withdrawal and recall. “We are voluntarily recalling this product as a precautionary measure, on the global instruction of the Hungarian Food Safety Agency,” Woolworths said in a statement dated July 10. On July 4, Greenyard Factory announced a recall of frozen vegetables due to potential listeria contamination of frozen goods at its Hungary facility in Baja. The products involved included frozen corn, peas, beans, spinach, and sorrel, Greenyard said. Woolworths, which sells food, clothes, and homeware, said its product was sourced from Belgium and contained frozen sweetcorn from the Greenyard Factory. Other frozen sweetcorn and vegetable products are not affected, the retailer added.  -(Reuters)
