JOHANNESBURG, July 16 – Former US President Barack Obama has returned to Kogelo, his ancestral home in Kenya’s Siaya County, on his first Africa tour after leaving the White House, the Daily Nation reported on Monday. Obama, who was not accompanied by his family, left the capital Nairobi on Monday morning on a private jet that touched down at Kisumu International Airport on the shores of Lake Victoria. He then travelled to Kogelo, amid tight security involving the US Secret Service and Kenya’s security agencies, to meet his grandmother Sarah Obama. On his arrival in Kogelo, excited villagers welcomed the return of their “son”. It was Obama’s first visit to the village in over a decade. He last visited there in 2006 when he was the senator for Illinois State. The former president then joined up with family members before heading to open the Sauti Kuu Resource Centre, the multi-million-shilling youth centre built by his half-sister Auma Obama. Guests who attended the opening included South Africa’s Yvonne Chaka Chaka, Ida Odinga, wife of Kenya’s opposition leader Raila Odinga, and Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga. – African News Agency (ANA)
