JOHANNESBURG, July 18 – Police in Cape Town on Wednesday arrested a Chinese national after they caught him driving a stolen car that was filled with thousands of units of abalone. “Our endeavours to root out the lucrative abalone trade in the Western Cape resulted in the arrest of a Chinese man in his twenties for being in possession of a hijacked vehicle and 4297 units of abalone today,” said Lieutenant Colonel Andrè Traut. “Members of the Flying Squad spotted a suspicious Hyundai i20 in Koeberg Road and pulled it over for further investigation. The investigation led to the discovery that the vehicle was hijacked in Mfuleni earlier this month with abalone inside with an estimated street value of R 250,000. “The vehicle and the abalone were confiscated. Once charged, the suspect is due to make a court appearance in Cape Town.” – African News Agency (ANA)
