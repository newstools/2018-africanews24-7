JOHANNESBURG, July 30 – After the elections are done, Zimbabwe will remain home to both winners and losers, President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who is also Zanu PF presidential candidate, said as Zimbabweans go to the polls on Monday, according to a report. In an impassioned address to citizens on the eve of what he called the most significant plebiscite since independence, Mnangagwa warned citizens and candidates in particular against breaking the law, NewsDay reported. Mnangagwa added that since he took power in a military coup in November last year, the country has seen greater civil liberties and more democracy. “As we have always said the election will be free, fair, non-violent and credible. The hour to complete this pledge is only a day away. The voice of the people will be loudly heard again… With over 130 political parties and 23 presidential candidates competing for your vote, this has been the most hotly contested campaign in our history as a country,” he was quoted as saying. “The people of Zimbabwe have been given a range of choices and have been exposed to a robust free exchange of ideas like never before. In a day’s time, you will determine the future of our Zimbabwe. “I urge you to use your power wisely remembering at all times that the responsibility for peace and unity lies with us all. Let us all citizens and candidates alike be respectful, tolerant and love one another. “Let us remember that no matter who we support we are all brothers and sisters and that above Zimbabwe after the poll will still be home to us winners and losers alike,” said Mnangagwa. – African News Agency (ANA)
