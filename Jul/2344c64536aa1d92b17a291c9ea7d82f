Dear Comrades I am putting this out on social media because a campaign to discredit me by journalists in the Sunday Times and Financial Mail is in full swing. I stupidly agreed to an interview at my home with a Sunday Times Journalist who pretended to want to discuss the ANC Dispute resolution mechanism. His questions turned to why Tony Yengeni was appointed as Head of the NEC committee on Safety and Security when he had been charged with corruption. I answered that I thought the mistake cde Tony made was not to declare that he had received a discount on a car. On Monday Eusebius MaKaizer dedicated a show on this denigrating me. On Tuesday Business Day gave me a red robot. Today Financial Times dedicated its editorial to this matter. I am now the problem. I know how this works the powerful financial mafia sent this journalist and want to show me as an ingrate. The question on cde Tony is lost in analyzing me. I have lived with fact less innuendo from the media for a long time. I am guilty by any association. I will not discard comrades because some people find them inconvenient. I will not pander to populism at the expense of principle. Anyone who has offended the state including those whose children are given contracts illegally must be brought to book with facts. The anger of a former minister or a former MEC cannot replace facts nor can it shade the truth. Jessie Duarte is ANC Deputy Secretary General
