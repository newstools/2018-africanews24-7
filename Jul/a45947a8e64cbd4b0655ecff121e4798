ROUBAIX (Reuters) – Australian Richie Porte has pulled out of the Tour de France after damaging his shoulder in a crash 10 kilometres into the ninth stage, a 156.5-km ride from Arras on Sunday. The BMC Racing rider, who also crashed out of the Tour last year, was one of the main contenders to finish on the podium in Paris. Porte finished fifth overall in 2016. He was sitting 10th in this year’s race, 57 seconds behind yellow jersey holder Greg van Avermaet of Belgium.
