JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) – South Africa’s power utility Eskom said on Tuesday it has implemented controlled electricity cuts after the company’s power supply was affected by labour unrest by workers who are demanding higher wages. “Stage 1 rotational loadshedding implemented this evening,” Eskom said on its Twitter account. Eskom had earlier warned it would implement the power outages from 5 p.m. (1500 GMT) to 9 p.m.
