Staff Reporter JOHANNESBURG- The Academic and Professional Staff Association (APSA) has come out on Tuesday condemning the exploitation of workers at the Phumelela Gaming and Leisure company. The workers have expressed their dismay about the working conditions to which they are subjected to. According to ordinary workers with more than twenty years’ of experience, they do not have employment contracts, payslips, provident fund, medical aid and are currently being retrenched. “We are shocked and traumatised at the conditions that workers at the Phumelela Gaming and Leisure Company are subjected to. As a JSE listed company which makes Billions annually from events such as Vodacom Durban July, Cape Town J& B Met, Sansui Summer Cup et cetera, Phumelela ought to be investigated, boycotted and penalised for abusing workers who are the core of the horse racing industry” said APSA in a statement. The movement called on the Minister of Labour to urgently investigate the exploitative conduct by the management of the company towards their employees and immediately halt the unlawful retrenchment until measures are put in place to ensure management comply with labour regulations as set out in the Basic Conditions of Employment. “We also intend to expose these grave injustices to companies such as Vodacom, Sansui, Sun International, Maison Mumm just to name a few who are key partners of Phumelela on how this company flouts South African laws and treats their employees as slaves”. APSA said that it will render Phumelela facilities ungovernable until it complies with the laws of the country.
