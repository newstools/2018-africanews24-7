Zodidi Mhlana JOHANNESBURG- Patriotic Alliance (PA) leader and businessman Gayton McKenzie said that his party supports lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community, saying people should be allowed to be who they are. He commented on the issue after an ACDP councilor in the Nelson Mandela Bay municipality, councilor Lance Grootboom said homosexuality was an “abomination biblically.” PA, ACDP, EFF, UDM and the DA are part of a coalition government in the Nelson Mandela Bay municipality. McKenzie said continuous attacks on the LGBT group should not be tolerated. “We are living in a free country, people should love whoever they comfortable with. Many of these supposed straight men who always bash the LGBT community are straight during the day and very gay during the night, they hate who they are at night hence this constant attacking of gay people. The PA supports the LGBT community, we don’t only want their votes but we support their choice of whoever they want to love,” he said. Last week, Grootboom was quoted saying: “homosexuality is an abomination biblically. Our principles and values come from the bible and that is what we believe in and it’s what we believe in. It’s what we stand for. If God says it’s an abomination he knows why he said it was an abomination and why it is harmful. Homosexuality is a choice – like changing your sex if you want to male or female, that is your choice.” Grootboom made the controversial remarks after the municipality marked Pride Month by flying the largest pride flag. Grootboom said his party was opposed to the flying of the flag in the City. The City has since released a statement vowing its support to the LGBT community. Members of the LGBT community especially lesbians have been assaulted, raped and killed over the years by those who disagree with their sexuality. @Mhlana
