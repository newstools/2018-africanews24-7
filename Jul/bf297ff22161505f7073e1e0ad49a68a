Zodidi Mhlana JOHANNESBURG- Eastern Cape police have urged community members to refrain from taking the law into the own hands after a man was brutally assaulted and killed this week. Mthatha acting cluster commander Brigadier Nomawethu Makonza said that unknown people assaulted a 39-year-old man and killed at Lujecweni in Ngqeleni on Wednesday evening. “We condemn and discourage the acts of mob killings. People must not take law into their own hands. Anyone that is suspected to have committed an offense should be brought to us and face the law, however, we will leave no stone unturned in bringing the perpetrators of these crimes to book,” she said. Makonza said that the reason behind the killing was not clear but an investigation into the murder was ongoing. “The deceased was brought to the local chief’s place by local men who picked him up and the chief informed the police,” police spokesperson, Captain Dineo Koena said. Early this year, Limpopo police arrested three men for allegedly kidnapping and hacking two men to death in the bush in Mokhurumela village.  Some experts have cited a lack of trust in the justice system as one of the reasons behind community taking law into their own hands.
