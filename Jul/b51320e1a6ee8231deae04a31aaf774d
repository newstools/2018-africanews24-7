The Thinking Masses of South Africa Foundation (TMoSA) has said that it will refer the RAF and and possible collusion in the fuel price to the Public Protector to investigate. The organisation, which says it represents ordinary South Africans, further said in a press statement that it is outraged at the latest petrol price increase, announcing its “utter disdain and grave displeasure” at the petrol price. TMoSA conceded that global economics play a role in determining the petrol price but raised questions about the petrol levy and amounts paid to the Road Accident Fund (RAF). “With the rand staggering at R14 to the US dollar, 15% VAT, a jobless economy and several industries in job-shedding overdrive, the poor continue to suffer.  The fuel price has reached a new high of R16.02 a litre… “Firstly, SA is the main conduit for selling fuel to neighbouring countries, where fuel is sold much cheaper than locally. This means our fuel price is heavily influenced by levies loaded onto the pricing. “The most disconcerting and troublesome reality is that we learn of gross mismanagement in important entities such as the Road Accident Fund, subjecting itself to unscrupulous mismanagement, possible corruption and irresponsible spending, such as its alleged hiring of 300 chairs at R1666.00 per month, per chair.” Because of this, TMoSA said it would approach the Public Protector to investigate: “TMoSA herewith calls on South African citizens to refuse being subjected to this any longer and support all peaceful protests against a runaway fuel price and its downstream effects that are evidence of gross negligence on the part of entities such as the RAF,” its statement read.
