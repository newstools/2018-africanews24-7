JOHANNESBURG – Workers at some of the state-owned utility Eskom’s power stations have downed tools after an impasse over wages but supply has not been disrupted, spokesman Khulu Phasiwe said on Monday. A spate of controlled blackouts was triggered last month following worker-led protests after the cash-strapped utility, which provides virtually all of South Africa’s power, said it could not afford pay increases.  -(Reuters)
