JOHANNESBURG, July 9 – Police in Nigeria’s Plateau state have confirmed fresh outbreaks of violence over the weekend, Nigeria’s Premium Times reported. An attack occurred early Saturday morning on some Fulani communities around Police Staff College, Bukuru, Jos South Local Government Area of Plateau State. Two herders were injured, and a calf killed when approximately 200 Berom youths attacked Fulani herdsmen after surrounding their homes which were subsequently burned down. Police manage to restore law and order and a meeting has been arranged for all those involved and affected by the violence in an attempt to resolve issues. Nigeria has been wracked by inter-communal violence between nomadic Fulani herdsmen and settled farmers with the growing shortage of pasture land, exacerbated by climate change, increasing tensions. Plateau is one of the states most affected by this violence and has resulted in hundreds of deaths. On Sunday, the country’s presidency said most of the violence can be blamed on climate change and politicians who allegedly instigate such violence. (ANA)
