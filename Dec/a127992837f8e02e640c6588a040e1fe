JOHANNESBURG, December 6 – State power utility Eskom said on Thursday it would continue with the rolling power-cuts it has been forced to implement countrywide for more than a week to avoid a total collapse of the grid under demand pressure. “Eskom will implement stage 2 load-shedding today from 09:00 to 22:00 due to a shortage of capacity,” said the struggling utility, which has been rocked by allegations of misconduct against former senior executives. The load-shedding measure means Eskom will reduce a 2,000 MW load from the national grid at any given time within that time frame. – African News Agency (ANA)
