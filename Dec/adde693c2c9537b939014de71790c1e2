CAPE TOWN, December – The high court in Cape Town on Tuesday sentenced convicted child killer Mortimer Saunders to two life terms in prison. The sentences will run concurrently. Saunders, who was convicted in November for the rape and murder of 3-year-old Courtney Pieters, was also declared unfit to possess a firearm. The self-confessed child killer was arrested in May 2017 after the body of Pieters was found in Epping Industria, nine days after she was reported missing from her Elsies River home. Saunders denied raping the girl before she died but has admitted to necrophilia. He also claimed that she died after he fed her ant poison because she had been disturbing him at the house he shared with her and her family. – African News Agency (ANA)
