JOHANNESBURG, December 9 – Banyana Banyana coach Desiree Ellis said her side has been drawn in one of the toughest groups in the 2019 Women’s World Cup in France next year. South Africa were drawn alongside Germany, Spain and China in Group B for the Women’s World Cup to be held in France next year. “It’s a tough draw. With 24 teams at the World Cup you can’t expect an easy draw. We just have to plan and prepare really well. We have to triple our efforts,” said Ellis. The draw was held on Saturday in Paris. The tournament will take place from June 7 to July 7 in 2019. The three matches will be played in Le Havre (Spain), Paris (vs China) and in Montpellier (Germany). Ellis said not many had given Banyana a chance of competing with Nigeria in the Women’s Africa Cup of Nations. Banyana beat Nigeria in the group stage, before losing on penalties in the final on December 1. “When we drew Nigeria in Afcon people were saying ‘do you really think you can get a point off Nigeria’ and we beat them in the first game, and lost on penalties in the final.” Banyana have never played Germany or Spain, but did come up against China at the Rio Olympics in 2016 when South Africa went down 2-0. “We have to be in superb physical condition, but the players will be up for it.” (ANA)
