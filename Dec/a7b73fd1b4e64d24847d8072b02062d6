NAIROBI – Merger talks between NIC Bank and Commercial Bank of Africa were welcome because a deal would help strengthen the financial sector, Kenya’s finance minister said on Friday. The two Kenyan banks announced on Thursday that they would hold talks on a potential merger, which would be the first major deal since the government capped commercial lending rates in 2016.
