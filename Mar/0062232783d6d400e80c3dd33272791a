JOHANNESBURG, March 9 – The pre-sentencing proceedings of Preshalin Naidoo, who was involved in the car accident where Top Billing presenter Simba Mhere was killed, was postponed due to the probation officer’s report not being complete. Naidoo, 27, was found guilty of culpable homicide in January by the Randburg Magistrate’s Court for causing the fatal 2015 car accident that claimed the lives of Mhere and his friend Kady-Shay O’Bryan. The crash involved three cars and happened on William Nicol Drive in Fourways, Johannesburg, on January 31, 2015. During the trial, Naidoo said in an affidavit that the accident was caused by a mechanical malfunction of his vehicle and not due to negligent driving. The matter was postponed to 19 April.
