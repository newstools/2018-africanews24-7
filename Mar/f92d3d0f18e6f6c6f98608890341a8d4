Sello Theletsane JOHANNESBURG- International Women’s Day was first celebrated in 1911 and its centenary was celebrated in 2011. This year we’re celebrating the 107th International Women’s Day. This year International Women’s Day theme, which is on the 08th of March, is: “Time is now, Rural and Urban activists transforming women’s lives”. The Deputy Secretary-General of the ANC called on all women to rise on this Internationally celebrated day. “International Women’s Day is upon us. It is one day that still has the integrity of its origins, women marching for better wages”. “In SA the meaningful reminder of this day is that despite equality clauses and acts of law women are not equal to men. We have bowed down to patriarchy and modernised its crude characteristics” said Duarte. “We joke along with the archetypal traditionalists who tell us what to do, when and how. We have forgotten the triple oppressive nature of capitalism”. “Women arise”
