JOHANNESBURG, March 2 – As Kenya’s police reel from a devastating attack early Friday morning by militant group Al Shabaab that left five officers dead and three others seriously injured, an investigation into the killing of two Al Shabaab returnees is being carried out by the police force. Up to 100, Al Shabaab extremists attacked both the Kenya Police and Administration Police camps in Fino in Mandera county in the early hours of Friday morning killing the policemen. The seriously injured officers were airlifted to hospital and are currently being treated. However, earlier during the week the police launched an investigation in the coastal county of Kwale after two bodies, believed to be Al Shabaab members, with multiple gunshot wounds were found dumped in the forest by unknown people. “The bodies were found dumped at Shimba Hills forest with gunshot wounds to their heads,” said Kwale police commander Tom Odera. A preliminary police report indicated that they might have been tortured before they were shot dead at close range. The decomposing bodies had no identification documents on them so police are waiting on the identification of fingerprints lifted from the corpses. Once the families of the dead men have been contacted autopsies will be conducted. Sources within the National Intelligence Service and criminal investigations agency said the two might have been on a police terror watch list. Nairobi has been battling Al Shabaab for a number of years following repeated attacks carried out in Kenya targeting civilians and security forces. – African News Agency (ANA)
