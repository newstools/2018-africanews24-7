Zodidi Mhlana JOHANNESBURG- Nearly ten shops were damaged when a blaze engulfed a building in Joburg CBD on Tuesday according to City of Johannesburg’s Emergency Management Services. City of Johannesburg’s Emergency Management Services Services spokesperson, Nana Radebe on Tuesday said that there were no fatalities recorded. “We received a call just before 10 am and when we arrived at the scene, there were blazes everywhere. We have three fire engines on the scene with a water tanker. Fortunately, there are no fatalities or causalities reported. The fire happened in a building that is being used, it has nine shops at the bottom, on top it’s partly residential, there’s a church,” she said. The cause of the fire is yet to be determined. “We are still busy extinguishing the fire, making sure that it does not reignite. After that we will conduct preliminary investigations,” Radebe said. Radebe said that while fire occurs in Joburg CBD during this season, they are widespread during the winter season. In 2017, seven people lost their lives when a building caught fire in Joburg’s Central Business District. @Mhlana
