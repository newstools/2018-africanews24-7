Ayanda Mdluli JOHANNESBURG- The Tiso Blackstar owned Sunday Times publication is caught in the middle of a race row as the company’s leading black investigative journalists lodged a scathing grievance report with the management of the group, citing low morale, racism and lack of financial benefits that are in contrast, afforded to white journalists in the publication. Even though the Sunday Times made a profit last year, the black collective of investigative journalists at the publication who have been dominating the bylines throughout 2017 complained that they are still at the margins of lucrative salary increases in the company. Tiso Blackstar, which owns the Sunday Times is also being accused of being apathetic towards the plight of black titles in its stable, such as The Sowetan and The Sunday World, so much so that the company is virtually accused of being a platform for stress-induced meltdowns which has seriously affected some its senior journalists. Things got so bad that the likes of so-called “superstar” journalist Karyn Maughan were not received with open arms by disgruntled senior journalists at the Sunday Times over allegations that she is to be paid a salary in the region of about R100 000 at the embattled publication. In a leaked letter to management seen by Africa News 24-7, a group of disgruntled black journalists led by renowned investigative journalists Mzilikazi wa Afrika and Sabelo Skiti accused management of conducting a blanket approach towards salary increases with no consideration of individual performances and increased work responsibilities in the group.         In the letter, the two further state that: “This blanket approach has essentially become a punitive measure for those who work hard and take pride in leading the conversation in South Africa. An example of this is that one of the senior journalists effectively got a R45 salary increase.” Between 2016 and 2017, Tiso Blackstar had engaged in a series of retrenchments in order to maintain profitability while keeping its talent base. However, the situation has been rendered a dubious process by the black collective which questioned why Maughan was brought in at “ludicrous” salary of R100 000 a month. “The general feeling is made worse by the fact that despite this supposedly tough financial period, the company sees it fit to bring in other talent such as Karyn Maughan at ludicrous rates without addressing our concerns,” reads the letter. The collective states that Maughan is coming in at a retainer of R100 000 even though there is no clarity on what her role is going to be in the group. “There was no clarity from editorial management on Maughan despite us hearing confirmations in the industry that she is joining Tiso Blackstar at a heavily inflated rate…We cannot help but notice the racial undertones in what we perceive to be as clear preferential treatment or perhaps management needs to be clear on whether the new hires, who we view as media colleagues, are so superior to the current crop of seniors that it warrants such pay and disparities. This is not the only case, we are also aware of other instances where black managers earn less than the people who report to them and we see the racial composition of news desks particularly since the merge of The Times and Timeslive across the Sunday Times stream.”  An employee in the organisation who spoke to Africa News 24-7 on condition of anonymity for fear of losing his job alleges that the pay disparities between black and white employees in the group is a major cause for concern. He claims that the problem has been there for decades and will not go away because racism is still prevalent in the organisation across a wide range of titles in the group. In addition, in newsrooms black journalists who often work twice as hard as their white colleagues get told that they should be grateful when they are given R15 000 to R20 000 a month for producing hard-hitting content.  “In some instances, white reporters and news editors in the newsrooms have the nerve to tell us that we are not there on merit, but we are only there because of affirmative action and Black Economic Empowerment. Even for the current editor of the Sunday Times, Bongani Siqoko, I will not be surprised if he earns considerably less than his white predecessors. Something needs to be done but people are afraid to speak out because they will lose their jobs,” he said.  @AyandaMdluli28
