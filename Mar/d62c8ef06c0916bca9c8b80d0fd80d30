CAPE TOWN, March 22 (ANA) – The Democratic Alliance (DA) will on Thursday announce its ruling on whether Cape Town Mayor Patricia de Lille’s disciplinary hearing can be open to the public and the media, following the postponement of the announcement which was expected on Tuesday. The hearing spent the whole day on Tuesday debating issues, which according to De Lille, were technical issues surrounding the hearing, including the appointment of the panel and the constitutional requirements of the party. “There will be no sitting tomorrow, I have some engagements already and then the sitting will be Thursday,” De Lille HAD told journalists outside Parliament on Tuesday. The party has charged De Lille with misconduct, maladministration and corruption. The disciplinary proceedings are set to take place Thursday and Friday. ANA
