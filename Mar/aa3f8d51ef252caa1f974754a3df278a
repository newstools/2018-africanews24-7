JOHANNESBURG, March 23 – A motion to impeach President Edgar Lungu has been submitted to the clerk of Zambia’s National Assembly by Mazabuka Member of Parliament Gary Nkombo and his ruling Patriotic Front (PF) counterpart for Roan, Chishimba Kambwili. Members of the country’s parliament have also submitted grounds, and signatures from one-third of the members of the House, supporting the notice of motion. However, PF media director Sunday Chanda said the impeachment motion would not see the light of day because the reasons for the impeachment were baseless and malicious. Chanda also accused Nkombo of being a political lightweight acting on the instructions of opposition leader Hakainde Hichilema and attempting to remain relevant in the political arena. According to Chanda, Kambwili’s motives were also opportunistic but he did not go into detail on these. – African News Agency (ANA)
