Zodidi Mhlana JOHANNESBURG- Dozens of National Education, Health, and Allied Workers’ Union (Nehawu) members at the Durban University of Technology who have been protesting over wage increase for the past seven weeks are set to return to work. The strike has been ongoing for nearly two months after Nehawu and the institution failed to reach an agreement. The industrial action which began at the beginning of the year has disrupted academic activities at the institution. Nehawu has been demanding an 8,5% while the university has offered 6,5%. Higher Education and Training Deputy minister Buti Manamela on Friday said that he was happy that workers were finally going back to work. “I am very pleased and relieved that the DUT can now begin with the 2018 academic programme. I would like to thank all the parties for putting the interest of students and workers alike and reaching an agreement. I urge all the students who had left campus to return to campus and work towards their qualifications,” Manamela said. Parties involved in the dispute only agreed to return to the negotiations table on Wednesday after Manamela intervened. Manamela had a meeting with the University Council and management as well as the labour unions including Fedusa. Nehawu spokesperson, Khaya Xaba on Friday said: “Negotiations are ongoing and a resolution should be found by the end of today. Where they get money from is none of our business, they have employees to take care of,” Xaba said. @Mhlana
