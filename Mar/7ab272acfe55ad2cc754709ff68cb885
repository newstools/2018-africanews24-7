JOHANNESBURG, March 12 (ANA) – Kagiso Rabada set the tone on day four as he dismissed Mitchell Marsh with his sixth delivery of the day to set South Africa up for a series-levelling six-wicket victory over Australia in the second Test in Port Elizabeth on Monday. Rabada went on to finish with three of the five wickets on the final morning as the Proteas were left to score 101 for victory. Rabada’s innings return of 6/104 gave him his fourth 10-wicket haul at this level, only one shy of Dale Steyn’s South African best. Rabada has taken 30 wickets in five Tests in the current calendar year and this was his second 10-wicket haul this summer. AB de Villiers’ unbeaten century in the first innings must have pushed him hard as Rabada took the Man of the Match award with his match figures of 11/150. The two teams now move on to Newlands for the third Test match starting next week Thursday with the final Test over the Easter weekend at the Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg. ANA
