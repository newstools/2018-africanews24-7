Cape Town, March 26 – Steve Smith stepped down as Australia captain on Sunday and has been suspended for one test by the International Cricket Council (ICC). This has come amid stunning ball-tampering revelations which have plunged the test team into crisis. Smith was also fined 100 percent of his match fee, while opening batsman Cameron Bancroft was handed three demerit points and a 75 percent fine of his match fee. Bancroft was caught on camera attempting to alter the condition of the ball. He, however, escaped a ban and is therefore free to play in the fourth test starting in Johannesburg on Friday if selected. David Warner also resigned as vice-captain on Sunday amid shock and disappointment at the conduct of the team back home. Cricket Australia said Smith and Warner had agreed to give up their leadership roles following “discussions” with the governing body. Wicket-keeper Tim Paine is to take the reins for the remainder of the third test in Cape Town and mostly likely now the fourth. “This test match needs to proceed, and in the interim we will continue to investigate this matter with the urgency that it demands,” CA CEO James Sutherland said in a statement. “Cricket Australia and Australian cricket fans expect certain standards of conduct from cricketers representing our country, and on this occasion these standards have not been met,’’ Sutherland said.
