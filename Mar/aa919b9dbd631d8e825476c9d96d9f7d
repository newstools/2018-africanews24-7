JOHANNESBURG, March 19 – The South Gauteng High Court in Johannesburg on Monday ruled in favour of Export Development Canada (EDC) and ordered the grounding of the jet leased by Gupta family whose whereabouts remain a mystery. Earlier this months the EDC requested the court to ground the Bombardier Global 6000 aircraft, leased by the Guptas because they had defaulted on payments and could also possibly use the jet in the commission of a crime. At the time Phil Taylor, a spokesman for the firm that provides Canadian exporters with trade financing said EDC “is petitioning the courts to ground the aircraft”. Advocate Alfred Cockerell for EDC told the court the tracker on the jet had been switched off so it could not be traced. He asked the court to enforce its right to cancel the lease agreement and have the plane located and placed in a safe place The Canadian bank moved to interdict the family to stop them from using the jet after they defaulted on the loan. The Guptas still owe the bank US$27-million. On Monday the high court ruled that the Guptas must hand over the Bombardier to EDC and have it stored at Lanseria Airport in Johannesburg. The Guptas have been interdicted from using the jet. – African News Agency (ANA)
