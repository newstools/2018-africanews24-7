NAIROBI, March 29 (Reuters) – A Kenyan opposition politician
who government authorities deported in contravention of a court
order said on Thursday he had been assaulted, drugged and
dragged onto a flight to Dubai. Miguna Miguna was put on an Emirates flight late on
Wednesday evening, his lawyer Cliff Ombeta said, two days after
police detained the politician on his return to the country. His deportation marks a significant escalation in a tussle
between the judiciary and the government of President Uhuru
Kenyatta, which opposition leaders and other critics say fails
to respect the authority of the courts in political matters. Miguna said he had been dragged, assaulted and drugged
during the forced deportation. “I’m sick. I need medical
treatment…I need urgent help here,” he said in a posting on
Twitter. The interior ministry would issue a statement soon,
spokesman Mwenda Njoka told Reuters. Kenyan authorities initially deported Miguna in February,
saying he had rescinded his Kenyan citizenship when he acquired
Canadian nationality but a court ruled he should be allowed
back. The ministry had denied that Miguna was being held illegally
and said he had failed to follow arrival procedures when he
landed in Kenya. The politician said in a statement posted on Facebook that
he was detained in a lavatory in an arrivals hall. A Kenyan high court judge on Wednesday found the Interior
Minister and the police chief guilty of contempt and told them
to appear for sentencing because they failed to obey the court
order to release Miguna. The judge said he would read their sentence on Thursday
morning in a Nairobi court, but it was unclear what impact that
would have. (Writing by Maggie Fick; editing by Elias Biryabarema and John
