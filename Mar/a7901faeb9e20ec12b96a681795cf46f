JOHANNESBURG, March 3 (ANA) – The trial against student activist Mcebo Dlamini is expected to begin on July 30, in the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court. On Friday,  Dlamini — who is facing charges of violating a court order, public violence, assault, theft and damage to property during the 2016 protest against colonised tertiary education — briefly appeared in court before the case was postponed to July for trial. Last week, Dlamini refused to accepted a plea bargain with the State because it would mean he would have a criminal record which would prevent him from practising law in the future. National Persecution Authority (NPA) regional spokesperson, Phindi Mjonondwane, said the NPA would not be pressurised. “As the NPA we have confidence in the prosecutor assigned to the case and we support him. The NPA is not a political organisation so we can not be pressurised by a political party,” she said. “As much as the citizens of the country have the right to protest, we were concerned by the criminal aspects of the trial,” she said. Speaking to the media, Dlamini said he is relieved that a trial date had been set. “We are relieved that we are eventually going to trial and we have said to the State find us guilty but they have been struggling,” Dlamini said following proceedings. “I’m confident that I will be vindicated and the state will have to find me guilty.” – African News Agency (ANA)
