Uber is now banned from testing its self-driving cars in Arizona. Governor Doug Ducey on Monday blocked the tests on public roads. That’s after a fatal crash last week killed a pedestrian. A 49-year-old woman was crossing a road at night in a Phoenix suburb when she was hit by one of Uber’s self-driving SUVs. Arizona police have since released video showing the moments just before impact, which Governor Ducey has called “alarming and disturbing”. He also called the accident “an unquestionable failure”. The suspension is a set back for the ride-hailing firm which is relying on driverless vehicles as its next big shift. Up till now, Arizona had been a welcoming host – offering wide and open roads, good weather, and a light regulatory touch. Uber moved its self-driving fleet there from California after the state shut it down for lacking permits. About half of the Uber’s 200 self-driving cars are based in Arizona, but none have been on the road since March 18th, the day of the deadly crash. Reuters
