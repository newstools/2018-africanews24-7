BRISBANE, Australia – Matt Renshaw hit the winning runs to help Queensland state clinch the domestic cricket title before heading for South Africa to reinforce an Australia squad mired in a cheating scandal ahead of the fourth test later this week in Johannesburg. Australia skipper Steve Smith has been suspended by the International Cricket Council for the match for his part in a ball-tampering scandal during the third test. Opener Cameron Bancroft was also sanctioned by the ICC after admitting to using tape covered with dirt to rub one side of the leather ball to make it rougher and assist reverse swing for the Australian bowlers during a heavy loss in Cape Town last weekend. Smith admitted some senior players were aware of the tampering attempt. He and vice-captain David Warner agreed to stand down as team leaders pending an investigation by Cricket Australia which is expected to result in further sanctions possibly for both the senior batsmen and Bancroft. Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland was expected to make an announcement Wednesday regarding the findings of the investigation. The 21-year-old Renshaw, who was replaced as Australian opener by Bancroft before last year’s Ashes series against England, has returned to form since being sent back to the domestic Sheffield Shield first-class competition. He capped his national recall with an unbeaten 81 on Tuesday in Queensland’s nine-wicket win over Tasmania in the final before departing for South Africa. –(AP)
