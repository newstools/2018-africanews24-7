JOHANNESBURG, March 19 (ANA) – Two Japanese Defence Force officers committed suicide after returning home from the United Nations (UN) peacekeeping mission in South Sudan, according to recent media reports. The Japan Times reported the deaths in response to questions raised by Tomoko Abe, the House of Representatives lawmaker from the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan. However, the Japanese government, in a written statement, said the officers’ death was not linked to their previous work in South Sudan. Japan ended its peacekeeping mission in war-torn South Sudan last March, subsequently withdrawing its 350 member force which had served in the UN Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) since November 2016, focusing mainly on road construction. Japan’s government recently reinterpreted its constitution, drafted after World War 11 and which forbids the use of force in settling international disputes, to use limited force in certain situations. – African News Agency (ANA)
