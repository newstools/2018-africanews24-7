Zodidi Mhlana JOHANNESBURG- The number of South Africans who have died due to the current listeriosis outbreak has increased to 183 from 180. The National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) has appealed to health care workers to continue with vigilance “for new cases as persons who have consumed implicated processed meat products over the past few weeks may continue to present with listeriosis.” The number of laboratory-confirmed listeriosis cases has also increased to 967, with eight additional cases reported to the NICD over the last few days. At least 669 patients have been traced. National Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi on Sunday announced that processed food manufacturers Enterprise, which is part of Tiger Brands, and Rainbow Chicken Limited had been issued with safety recall notices following the outbreak. The Enterprise food production facility in Polokwane, Limpopo has been identified as the source of the current listeriosis outbreak. Production at Rainbow chicken factories in Germiston and the Free State have also been halted production due to the outbreak. The health department has appealed to communities to stop purchasing and eating processed food items including polony, Russians, ham, and viennas. Major retailers have all withdrawn all ready to eat products from the shelves during the start of the week. Listeriosis is a serious, but treatable and preventable disease which is caused the bacterium, Listeria monocytogenes. The disease can be found in soil, water, and vegetation. Officials said that pregnant women, elderly people, pregnant women and people with a weak immune system are all at risk of contracting the disease. @Mhlana
