SYDNEY Australia March 29 – Australia’s David Warner has apologised for his part in the ball-tampering controversy that saw him banned from international cricket for 12 months. Warner addressed fans on social media and acknowledged that the incident was “a stain on the game we all love”. “Mistakes have been made which have damaged cricket. I apologise for my part and take responsibility for it,” he wrote. “I understand the distress this has caused to the sport and its fans. [It’s] a stain on the game we all love and I have loved since I was a boy. “I need to take a deep breath and spend time with my family, friends and trusted advisers. You will hear from me in a few days.” Warner along with Steve Smith were handed 12-month bans from international cricket and stripped off their roles as vice-captain and captain respectively by Cricket Australia (CA) for violating the Code of Conduct. Cameron Bancroft, Warner’s opening partner, who was found tampering the ball using sandpaper during the second session on day three of the Cape Town Test against South Africa, was handed a nine-month ban. The CA investigation named Warner as responsible for “development of a plan to attempt to artificially alter the condition of the ball” and giving “instruction to a junior player to carry out a plan”. In addition to the ban, he will never be considered for any leadership position. – African News Agency (ANA)
