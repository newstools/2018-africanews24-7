The party described him as a “hard-hitting journalist” who specialised in education stories and “kept authorities on their toes”. “As an outspoken journalist, Mr. Ndlovu brightened many a day with his joyful eloquence reporting on the happenings in our province.  He was a permanent feature on our radio, especially Ukhozi FM’s current affairs shows. We are thankful for the role he played as he devoted his life to journalism,” said ANCKZN Provincial Interim Coordinator Sihle Zikalala. “Mr. Ndlovu worked tirelessly to ensure that South Africans talk and ultimately understand one another on various issues that form part of our national discourse, especially education. Although we were aware that he struggled with his health, we were not expecting that he will finally succumb to his ailment so early.” The party sent its condolence’s to Ndlovu’s family, friends and colleagues. – African News Agency (ANA)
