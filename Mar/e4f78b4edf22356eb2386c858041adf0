JOHANNESBURG, March 26 – For the first time in years Nigeria’s government is in talks with Islamist militant group Boko Haram about a possible ceasefire with the ultimate aim of securing a permanent cessation of hostilities. Abuja’s Information Minister Lai Mohammed confirmed that the talks have been ongoing for some time as part of President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration repeatedly saying it was willing to hold talks with the militants. Tens of thousands of people have been killed since Boko Haram began its insurgency in 2009 – with the aim of establishing an Islamic state – an insurgency that has now spread from Nigeria to neighbouring Chad, Cameroon and Niger.
