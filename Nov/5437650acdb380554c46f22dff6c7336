DURBAN, November 19 – South Africa will turn their attention away from the highly-pressured Afcon qualifying mission as Bafana Bafana prepare for the Nelson Mandela Challenge match against Paraguay at the Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban on Tuesday (start at 7pm). This will be Bafana Bafana’s second game in three days having played to a 1-1 draw with Nigeria in an Afcon qualifier at the FNB Stadium on Saturday. While temperatures in Gauteng have been hovering around 35 degrees Celsius, the players were met with some light rain at King Shaka International Airport upon their arrival in Durban just before midday on Sunday. Part of Sunday’s programme included a short rest before heading towards Moses Mabhida for a routine training session in preparation for Paraguay, and will wrap up training at the match venue on Monday. Both Bafana and Paraguay will attend a dinner organised by Safa and the Nelson Mandela Children’s Fund (NMCF) at the ICC on Monday evening. Tickets are available at Computicket, Shoprite and Shoprite Checkers stores countrywide for R40. Part of the benefits from this encounter will go towards the NMCF’s hospital fund and for their part, Safa will donate R1,5 million towards this cause. (ANA)
