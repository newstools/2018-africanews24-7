Sello Theletsane JOHANNESBURG- Johannesburg Mayor Herman Mashaba has apologised after he posted on his twitter account earlier this week that he had performed a citizen’s arrest on a man lugging a trolley of cow heads. The tweet sparked criticism that Mashaba, a self-made businessman, was now bent on repressing fellow blacks struggling to make ends meet in a country with an unemployment rate of more than 27 percent. In the face of social media backlash over his comments, Mashaba has since tweeted that he fully supported informal traders in the city “as much as I support the health of residents”. “Our Health Inspectors will be working with street vendors in the inner city to support them to meet our environmental health codes while working to earn a living,” he wrote. Mashaba has previously been criticised over his vocal stance against mostly African illegal immigrants in the city, although supporters have applauded him.
