JOHANNESBURG, November 5 – Kaizer Chiefs coach Giovanni Solini said his team showed character in beating a resilient SuperSport United 1-0 in a Telkom Knockout semifinal at the Moses Mabhida Stadium, in Durban, on Sunday. Solinas said: “SuperSport are a good team and very difficult to beat. They are very physical and tactically strong.” Chiefs have now advanced to the semifinals of the competition where they will meet Orlando Pirates. “We played very well in the first half, while we soaked up the pressure in the second half,” reflected Solinas. “We were not so fluid though. But we will take this win to the next game to improve our log position.” George Maluleka returned to the starting line-up after having missed out on the Soweto Derby. “George is our box-to-box player,” commented the Italian coach. “He did his job excellently. With this kind of gallant performance from my team, we don’t fear any opponent.” On the topic of supporters calling for substitutions, Solinas replied: “I focus on the match and not on the stands. “In fact, the fans pushed us to this win. We had an advantage with them behind us.” Chiefs will on Wednesday turn their attention to the Premiership when they welcome Black Leopards. The game is scheduled for a 7.30pm kick-off at FNB Stadium.(ANA)
