LONDON, November 5 – Manchester City moved two points clear at the top of the English Premier League after thrashing Southampton 6-1 at the Etihad on Sunday. The Blues raced into a three-goal lead inside the opening 18 minutes thanks to an own goal from Wesley Hoedt and the brilliance of Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling. In the sixth minute, Hoedt struck high into his own net when trying to clear Leroy Sane’s a low cross. Six minutes later, Aguero scored from close range on a cross from Sterling, his 150th Premier League goal. David Silva made it 3-0 in the 18th minute before Danny Ings pulled one back from the spot after Ederson brought him down in the area. Sterling then netted either side of the break to complete an impressive personal performance, while Sane added a late sixth to cap off a fine afternoon for Pep Guardiola’s men. Guardiola said, “It’s a joy to be manager of them because they follow what we tell them. “In training, I try to argue why we should play this way. It’s a joy and a pleasure for the staff.” Chelsea’s impressive early-season form continued as they beat Crystal Palace 3-1 at the Stanford Bridge to move past Liverpool to the second place on goal difference. The hosts sent ahead after the half-hour mark when Alvaro Morata swivelled to score from close range following good work by Pedro. Palace pulled it even eight minutes after the restart through Andros Townsend, but two goals in the space of five minutes, first from Morata and then Pedro, put Chelsea firmly in control of the contest.   (Xinhua)
