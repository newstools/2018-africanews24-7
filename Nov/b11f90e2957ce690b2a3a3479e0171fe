JOHANNESBURG, November 2 – Jozi Stars batting star Chris Gayle has been confirmed for the Mzansi Super League first weekend when he turns out for his team’s first fixture against Nelson Mandela Bay Giants at Bidvest Wanderers on November 17. Gayle, with his swashbuckling batting style, is arguably one of the best-ever limited overs cricketers and is considered the prototype T20 cricket player, holding the distinction of the highest T20 score ever (175 not out). The 39-year-old West Indian has a great history at the Wanderers, where he scored the first-ever century in the shortest format of the game back in 2007. Cricket SA Chief Executive, Thabang Moroe, said: “We are excited to have Chris part of this tournament from the start and he is looking forward to linking up with his Jozi Stars teammates. “Seeing the ‘World Boss’ back in South Africa and playing cricket – we and the fans could not have asked for anything better than one of the most popular players that have ever played the game.” Gayle joins an already formidable line-up at Stars with SA marquee bowler Kagiso Rabada, left arm paceman Beuran Hendricks as well as the stylish batsman, Reeza Hendricks. The other international marquee players are Rashid Khan (Durban Heat) Jason Roy (Giants), Eoin Morgan (Tshwane Spartans) and Dwayne Bravo (Paarl Rocks). – African News Agency (ANA)
