Staff Reporter JOHANNESBURG- City of Cape Town mayoral committee member for transport, Brett Herron has resigned from the Democratic Alliance with immediate effect. Brett Herron becomes the eighth member to resign from the DA.  Herron was scathing about the DA when he announced his decision to the media in Salt River, describing the party as “a lost cause”, whilst Patricia de Lille described the party as ‘Dramatic-Alliance’.  Herron took to social media to explain some of the reasons behind his resignation.  pic.twitter.com/6pqJptXYlK — Brett Herron (@brettherron) November 1, 2018
