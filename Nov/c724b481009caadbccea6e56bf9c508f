JOHANNESBURG – South African media and e-commerce giant Naspers Ltd said on Monday it expects first-half core headline earnings per share to be between 35 percent and 43 percent higher than a year earlier. Cape Town-based Naspers, which owns the largest stake in China’s Tencent Holdings, said core headline earnings per share are expected to be between 98 cents to $1.18 higher for the six months ended Sept. 30, from $2.77 a year earlier. Core headline earnings per share is Naspers’ main profit measure that strips out non-operational and one-off items. Naspers said first-half earnings per share were significantly boosted by the once-off gain after it sold https://www.reuters.com/article/us-naspers-disposal-flipkart/south-africas-naspers-sells-flipkart-stake-to-walmart-for-2-2-billion-idUSKBN1IA1S6 its entire 11.18 percent stake in Indian e-commerce firm Flipkart to Walmart Inc for $2.2 billion.
