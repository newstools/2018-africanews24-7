JOHANNESBURG, November 12 – Although former Transnet CEO Siyabonga Gama faced serious misconduct charges at the state-owned enterprise, former president Jacob Zuma was having none of it and insisted that Gama become CEO, former public enterprises minister Barbara Hogan told the Zondo commission on Monday. The charges against Gama related to the irregular awarding of an R18 million security contract to a company owned by former SANDF chief of staff and now MK Council president Siphiwe Nyanda. Gama was found guilty of every charge in 2010. He was then dismissed, only to be reappointed following ”a review of the dismissal.” The new board at the time that took over from Phaswana and was headed by Mafika Mkwanazi, reversed the previous board’s decision on Gama, allowing him to return to Transnet.
