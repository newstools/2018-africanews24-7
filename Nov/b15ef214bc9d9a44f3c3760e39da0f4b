JOHHANESBURG- Residents from Mangaung Metro Municipality will on Thursday protests at the Mangaung Metro Offices over poor service delivery and corruption, which the resident claims is because of weak and corrupt political leadership. The residents said they want to expose the rot, corruption and the parasitic patronage networks informed by self-aggrandizement, greed, self interest and self serving. “It is from that background that we become a united front against these ills facing and backwarding our developmental projects. The streets of Mangaung are dirty, spillage of sewerage, uneven roads, potholes, leaks of water etc”, said community member Thuso Bokwa. “We, as a people cannot fold our arms when those deployed to serve our communities drive around with German cars, live in suburban areas, far from the poor. In the light of the background above, we as responsible residents cannot fold our arms and watch our municipality fail to execute it’s Constitutional mandate of delivering basic services to residents”. Bokwa has further invited all residents of responsibility Mangaung, religious groups, political structures and NGO’s to join the march: “to protect against deeply-entrenched corruption that is preventing the municipality from discharging its Consitutional obligations,” he said.
