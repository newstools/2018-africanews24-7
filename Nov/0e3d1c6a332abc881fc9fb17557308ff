CAPE TOWN, November 7 – The Western Cape High Court on Wednesday found self-confessed child killer Mortimer Saunders guilty of rape and the premeditated murder of three-year-old Courtney Pieters. Judge Babalwa Mantame said during her judgement that the behaviour of Saunders is the “most brutal, ruthless and vicious this court has ever seen”. Courtney’s mother, Juanita Pieters, who had left Courtney and her older brother at home as she went to work, was granted immunity from prosecution. “This court is satisfied that the State proved its case beyond reasonable doubt,” Judge Mantame said. Judge Mantame, in her judgement, said the only conclusion that can be drawn is that self-confessed child killer Mortimer Saunders had penetrated the toddler with his penis. She said an explanation had been put forward that the multiple injuries to the opening of the toddler’s vagina could possibly have been caused by blunt force trauma. “If the accused’s explanation could be accepted, then where did the semen in the deep vaginal vault come from? There could be two reasons, this could be penile penetration or contamination,” Mantame said. However, she said it is highly improbable that the semen came from Saunders’ fingers and that the only conclusion that can be drawn is that Saunders penetrated the toddler with his penis. She added that there is enough proof beyond reasonable doubt that Courtney’s vaginal injuries were caused antemortem
