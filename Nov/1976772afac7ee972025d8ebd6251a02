Taiwan has been quietly working to change everyday life in remote villages in Myanmar. What hasn’t changed in the villages is the clean air and the pristine river water that still flows through this land as the sun beams down on it. The devout Buddhist villagers with their respect for the natural environment are still as pious and earnest as ever. What has changed in the villages is that accessing water is more convenient and the warm rays of the sun during the day are able to light up the night as well now. Although Taiwan is a small country, it’s brimming with love and concern for others. We believe that through warmth, we can help our friends in distant places overseas to improve their lives, fulfilling our duty as global citizens, to tackle climate change together. The video below summarizes the change that Taiwan is bringing about in the lives of the of people in Myanmar, fulfilling their duty as global citizens and tackling climate change. With the upcoming United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to be held in Katowice, Poland from the 2nd to 14th of December 2018, Taiwan is willing and eager to share their knowledge on climate change with others through their love and concern for their fellow human beings. This, however, can only be achieved if the people of the world set aside differences and work together towards halting climate change.
