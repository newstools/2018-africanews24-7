JOHANNESBURG, June 5 – Kenyan police are investigating eight staff members, including six teachers, at Moi Girls High School in the capital Nairobi following the rape of a student over the weekend at the boarding school. Detectives from the division of Serious Crimes Investigations and the government chemist on Monday took samples from eight staff members for forensic analysis, the Daily Nation reported on Tuesday. On Sunday night detectives from the DCI sent letters to relevant male staff members who live on the school grounds, and others who were present at the time of the rape, ordering them to make themselves available for DNA sampling. On Monday morning, as detectives extracted buccal swabs from the male teachers, old students, parents, leaders and anti-rape crusaders held demonstrations outside the school, demanding the resignation or indictment of the principal. The school was closed and will only be reopened after completion of investigations into the rape which took place at 2 am on Saturday morning as the student went to the toilet. Some parents removed their children from the school as early as 5 am the same morning while the rape victim was taken to Nairobi Women’s hospital where she is receiving treatment. Armed police have been deployed on the school grounds. – African News Agency (ANA)
