Gauteng police spokesperson, Colonel Brenda Muridili said that a police officer was killed during a shootout with the suspects on Thursday. The suspects made off with an undisclosed amount of money. “A number of unknown suspects attacked and fired shots at a parked CIT vehicle and fled the scene in vehicles with an undisclosed amount of money. The Johannesburg Metro Police Department responded and pursued the getaway vehicles. As a result of the attack and the shooting, two security guards and two bystanders were wounded,” she said. Seven firearms including rifles and pistols have been recovered and also three vehicles. A spike in robberies has been recorded since over the last six months, with over 160 cash-in-transit heists. It has also been discovered that military weapons and guns taken from police stations have been used in some of these robberies. Acting national Commissioner of police, Lieutenant General Sindile Mfazi on Thursday commended officers for their bravery. “Our members are fearless, they did not think twice before they confronted those brazen criminals. One of our own laid down his life to ensure the safety and security of the inhabitants of this country. With the Police’s 72-hour reaction plan activated, specialised dedicated teams are currently combing the scenes and have already made arrests and seized exhibits,” Mfazi said. Mfazi said that they would be visiting the family of the slain officer. Gauteng Community Safety MEC Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane recently said that she would be holding talks with the mining industry after it was discovered that explosives used to attack cash vans cam from the mining sector. @Mhlana
