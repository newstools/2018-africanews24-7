RUSTENBURG, June 18 (ANA) – Seventeen mineworkers facing multiple charges relating to a violent strike at Lonmin’s platinum mine at Marikana near Rustenburg about six years ago are due to appear in the North West High Court in Mogwase on Monday. Anele Zonke, Xolani Nzuzu, Simphiwe Booi, Khanyile Kanyise, Mzoxolo Magidiwana, Samekelo Mkhize, Amanda Nogwaza, Thobile Tyobeni, Mzukisi Soyini, Bongile Mpotye, Zamikhaya Ndude, Sithembele Sohadi, Loyiso Mtsheketshe, Zolile Honxo, Zwelitsha Mtshena, Mziwanele Mxinwa, and Mzoxolo Zukulu face 26 counts ranging from murder and attempted murder to malicious damage to property, robbery, and unlawful possession of firearms and ammunition. The charges relate to the murder of 10 people in the week before August 16, 2012, when 34 people, mostly mineworkers, were shot dead by police during a violent wildcat strike at Lonmin’s Marikana operations. The State alleges the group killed two Lonmin security officers, two policemen, and three non-striking workers, and damaged vehicles and robbed two Lonmin security officers of their firearms. Nineteen mineworkers were initially arrested, but two – Majeke Nonkonyana  and Dlunga Tholakele – have since died. Dlunga, known as “Bhele”, was shot dead in his shack on October 17, 2017.
