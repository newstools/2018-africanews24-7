JOHANNESBURG, June 5 – President Cyril Ramaphosa on Tuesday will receive President Abraham Ghali of the Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) who is in South Africa on a working visit. South Africa and the SADR enjoy cordial and fraternal relations that were forged during the struggle against colonialism and apartheid. South Africa formally recognised the SADR on 15 September 2004 and continues to support the inalienable right of the people of Western Sahara to self-determination and independence. However, Morocco occupies Western Sahara and doesn’t recognise SADR’s independence, while the international community is divided over recognition of what has been described as Africa’s last colonised state. Over the years, South Africa has extended material and technical support to the cause of the people of Western Sahara. The two countries have thus far concluded agreements in the fields of diplomacy, sports development, technical cooperation, and humanitarian assistance. It is expected that the two Heads of State will review bilateral cooperation between the two countries and exchange views on issues of common interest and mutual concern. Minister of International Relations and Cooperation Lindiwe Sisulu and Minister of State Security Dipuo Letsatsi-Duba will also attend the meeting. – African News Agency (ANA)
