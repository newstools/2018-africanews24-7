NAIROBI (Reuters) – African law enforcement
agencies should work closer together to stop the heroin and
other hard drugs passing through their territories, a senior
U.N. official said. African governments seized just 1 percent of the 658 tonnes
of opium, 91 tonnes of heroin and 65 tonnes of morphine
confiscated globally in 2016, Amado de Andrés, from the United
Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) said. “The problem is that there are not enough seizures in
Eastern and Southern Africa. And there are not enough seizures
in West and Central Africa,” de Andrés said at the launch of the
World Drug Report 2018 in Nairobi on Tuesday. Without tougher action, he added, there was a risk that
trafficking networks in the south and east of the continent
could start cooperating. “That’s the problem we’re going to be seeing in 2019 and
2020. The links between these two networks, which are not
happening yet, will happen,” said de Andrés, the agency’s
eastern African representative.
