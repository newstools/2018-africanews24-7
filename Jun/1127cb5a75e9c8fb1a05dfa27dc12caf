JOHANNESBURG, June 5 – Bafana Bafana will be out to restore some lost pride when they play Namibia in the plate semifinal of the Cosafa Cup at the Old Peter Mokaba Stadium on Tuesday (start 5 pm). Bafana midfielder Fortune Makaringe has admitted the team were hurting following the loss to Madagascar in the quarterfinal on Sunday but says they have to be professional enough and keep their heads up. South Africa was knocked out of the competition by the Islanders 4-3 on penalties after the match ended 0-0 at the end of regulation time. “It is a huge loss bearing in mind that we are the hosts, and much is expected from us, so it is a very difficult thing for the entire team that we lost,” said Makaringe. “We are all professionals, we have to encourage one another and keep our heads up, and if we don’t do that we will be in trouble again and suffer another loss.” The Maritzburg United player was making his debut for Bafana Bafana and impressed in the middle of the park. “It was a great feeling despite the fact that we lost. It would have been more meaningful though if we won the game, especially after the team played so well as a collective,” added Makaringe, who walked away with the Man-of-the-Match award for his sterling performance. “It’s all credit to the whole team, I could not have done it alone.” – African News Agency (ANA)
