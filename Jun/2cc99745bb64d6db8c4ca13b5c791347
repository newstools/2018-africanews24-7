JOHANNESBURG, June 1 (ANA) – Suspended SA Revenue Service (SARS) boss Tom Monyane, who is accused of beating up the teenage mother of his grandchild, did not appear at the Roodepoort Magistrate’s Court on Friday. The legal representative of the victim, Brighton Hlayisani, from BH Taula Attornies said: “From the information that we received from the DPP [The Director of Public Prosecutions]office is that the docket was before the court on Monday. “They have advised that police must do further investigations and once that is done they will proceed with the matter, but at this stage we don’t know when that will be,” said Hlayisani. Moyane is accused of assaulting the 17-year-old teenager, who has a six-month-old baby with his son. National Prosecution Authority regional spokesperson, Phindi Mjonondwane, said Moyane was not appearing “in court today”. Mjonondwane added: “The matter is still under consideration at the DPP office and has been assigned to a state advocate, should they decide to prosecute he will appear if not he won’t appear”. Moyane, the SARS commissioner who has been suspended from work for alleged wrongdoing, denies the assault allegations.
