Zodidi Mhlana JOHANNESBURG- International Relations and Cooperation (DIRCO) minister Lindiwe Sisulu said the government was working with the Chinese officials to facilitate the release of 51 South Africans stuck in the Asian county due to a visa scam. It recently emerged that 51 young South Africans have been detained in China after going to the Asian country to teach English. The students travelled to China on study visas to work as English teachers. They were informed that they would receive their visas after arriving in China, however, this never happened. They began working on students’ visas and got detained for breaching China’s immigration laws. Sisulu said that she would be contact with Home Affairs and Police ministers so that action could be taken against the agent behind the trip. The agent has since been arrested for fraud. “Our Embassy in Beijing is liaising with the Chinese authorities in addressing this matter. We are also in touch with the Chinese Ambassador to South Africa to have their passports released. The Chinese Ambassador to South Africa has made an undertaking that he will expedite the matter. We are very much aware that the Chinese authorities will follow their own legal process when such a violation occurs and deal with the matter accordingly,” Sisulu said in a statement today. It was reported that 35 of these teachers come from Krugersdorp, West Rand. Sisulu urged locals travelling to foreign countries to be vigilant at all times. “We appeal to all South Africans to be cautious of these scams and to check with the relevant authorities before travelling to other countries. DIRCO will continue to provide consular assistance to those South Africans in distress and also to keep those affected families informed of the latest developments,” she said. @Mhlana
