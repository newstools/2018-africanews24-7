The World Cup is in full swing. The superstars are showing their skill – and lack thereof at times – as the best in the world battle it out to become crowned world champions.

No matter where you stand in terms of the country’s policies you cannot deny that this uncle scored a smooth goal! Watch Ian Khama show off his soccer skill!
