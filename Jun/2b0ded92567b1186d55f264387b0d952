JOHANNESBURG, June 1 â€“ The retail price of petrol will rise by 5.5 percent from June 6, while the price of wholesale diesel will rise by 6.4 percent, the energy department said on Friday. The price of petrol will rise by 82 cents to 15.79 rand per
litre in the commercial hub of Gauteng province, while diesel
will go up by 85 cents to 14.19 rand per litre. The Central Energy Fund said the weaker rand exchange rate
versus the dollar was the main reason why fuel prices would rise
sharply. The rand has fallen more than 1 percent since
the beginning of May. Reuters
