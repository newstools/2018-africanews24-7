JOHANNESBURG, June 20 – The N3 Toll Concession on Wednesday asked motorists to delay their trips or use the alternative routes as the entire road was blocked by protest action in both directions at Van Reenens Pass between Harrismith and the Tugela Toll Plaza in Ladysmith. It was estimated that over 100 trucks had blocked the N3 at Van Reenen’s Pass on Wednesday morning as local truck drivers were protesting against the hiring of foreign nationals and allegedly taking their vehicle keys away from them. Motorists have been advised to use R74 Bergville, the R23, and N11 routes to avoid the traffic. The toll concession said that law enforcement and emergency services had been deployed to the area, but there was no indication when the road will be re-opened at this stage. In April, a number of trucks were set alight at the Mooi River toll plaza in KwaZulu-Natal as local truck drivers were protesting against truck company owners who use foreigners as drivers. – African News Agency (ANA)
