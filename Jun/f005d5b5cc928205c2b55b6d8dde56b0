 The North West has been placed under administration by the national government and was shaken by weeks of violent protests demanding Mahumapelo, who was widely accused of corruption, step down. Magashule added that the national leadership of the party was given three names by provincial structures and mulled it over at length to arrive “at a decision which we hope everybody will respect”. “We want somebody who can actually engage everybody and ensure there is unity and renewal during this period,” said Magashule. Mokgoro is a veteran public servant and the head of the national school of government.
