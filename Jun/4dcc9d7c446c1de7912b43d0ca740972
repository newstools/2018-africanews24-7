JOHANNESBURG, June 25 – Power utility Eskom said there was a low probability it would have to implement rotational load shedding on Monday as a result of several units being returned to service after a recent strike. “We continue to encourage residents and businesses to use electricity sparingly by switching off geysers during the day especially during peak periods as well as all non-essential lighting and electricity appliances,” it said. In the event that load-shedding became necessary, Eskom said it would use existing rotational load shedding schedules. – African News Agency (ANA)
