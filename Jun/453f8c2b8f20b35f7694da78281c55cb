MOSCOW, Russia, June 14 – Hosts Russia could not have wished for a better start to their own Fifa World Cup following their resounding 5-0 victory over Saudi Arabia on Thursday in their Group A match at the Luzhniki Stadium, Moscow. Iury Gazinsky scored the first goal of Russia 2018 with a firmly-placed header, before substitute Denis Cheryshev, who replaced the injured Alan Dzagoev, scored the second before the break. Artem Dzyuba’s goal came mere moments after being introduced before Cheryshev’s stunner and Aleksandr Golovin’s free-kick sealed the victory. If Russia’s coach Stanislav Cherchesov had a dream about this game before it started, it could not have been more perfect. Gazinksy’s early goal was a result of the pressure Russia applied. The hosts lost a creative influence in Dzagoev to an injury that could end up having big consequences later in the tournament, but his replacement scored an amazing goal after dribbling past three opponents. Dzyuba’s uber-motivation was reflected by his swift impact before Cheryshev and Golovin put the cherry on the cake. Cheryshev’s double, particularly the timeliness of his first goal just before halftime, earned him the Budweiser Man of the Match award. – African News Agency (ANA)
