JOHANNESBURG, June 7 – None of the eight passengers and two crew members of the FlySax plane that went missing for 36 hours and was subsequently found crashed in Kenya’s Aberdare National Fores have survived, FlySax chairman Charles Wako announced on Thursday afternoon at Weston Hotel in the Kenyan capital Nairobi. The Cessna C208 aircraft, registration number 5Y-CAC, left a Kitale airstrip in Trans-Nzoia County at 4.05 pm for Nairobi on Tuesday but lost contact with the control tower at 5.20 pm. An extensive aerial search was launched but bad weather on Wednesday hindered operations. The wreckage of the plane was discovered Thursday morning. Shortly after the damaged aircraft was discovered, the search and rescue operation kicked up a notch with rescuers rushing to the scene. However, the hopes of family members and friends were dashed when rescuers reached the crashed plane and identified the bodies of the dead passengers, including Captain Barbra Wangeci Kamau, and First Officer and co-pilot Jean Mureithi. – African News Agency (ANA)
