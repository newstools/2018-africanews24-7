CAPE TOWN, June 12 – English Premier League club Brighton & Hove Albion are reportedly eyeing out Mamelodi Sundowns sensation Percy Tau. Tau’s future has been the subject of much speculation after a breath-taking season from the 24-year-old saw him scoring 13 goals and providing a further 13 assists for Masandawana. He has also become Bafana Bafana’s go-to man up front and has already notched five goals in nine internationals for South Africa. While it looks a near certainty Tau will depart the PSL for Europe, there has been little clarity to which country he will be headed, with opinion split as to whether he would be able to handle the physicality of playing in England. That’s perhaps a little unfair on the player – despite his diminutive stature, Tau has shown when playing against some of the PSL’s most rugged defenders, not to mention some tough customers in continental and international competition, that he can hold his own. According to the Brighton-based publication The Argus, the Chris Hughton-coached team have the 2017/ 18 PSL Player of the Season on their radar: “The Argus can confirm the Seagulls are tracking Mamelodi Sundowns forward Percy Tau, who was recently named the top man in his domestic competition. “While no bid has been made, Albion remain interested in the South Africa international who also scooped Players’ Player of the Year honours recently in the top flight.” Brighton were promoted to the top flight at the end of the 2016/ 17 season and finished the last term in 15th spot, seven points clear of the drop zone. Glen Murray top scored with 12 league goals for the Seagulls, with Jose Izquierdo coming in next with five goals, the club scoring only 34 goals in 38 league matches, the fourth worst record in the Premiership. – African News Agency (ANA)
