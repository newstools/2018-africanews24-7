JOHANNESBURG, June 15 – Power utility Eskom said on Friday it would implement scheduled power interruptions, or load shedding for a second day to relieve pressure on the grid as it grapples with sabotage linked to a wage strike. “Eskom commenced with Stage 1 load shedding at 11:29 am today (15 June 2018). We anticipate that this will continue until 9 pm tonight,” the utility said. “This is due to the impact of the current illegal protest action by some Eskom employees at various sites over wage increases.” It said it was working with all the relevant stakeholders to keep its plant operating optimally, but there was a high risk of load shedding over the weekend. “Eskom calls on all consumers to assist by reducing their electricity consumption by switching off geysers, electric heating, pool pumps, and all non-essential appliances throughout the day,” it added. – African News Agency (ANA)
