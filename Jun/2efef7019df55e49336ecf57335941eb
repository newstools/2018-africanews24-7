JOHANNESBURG, June 21 (ANA) – The ruling African National Congress (ANC) will on Thursday announce its candidate as Premier of the North West province. In a media alert, the party said it would host a press conference at its party headquarters at Chief Albert Luthuli House in Johannesburg. “ANC Secretary General Cde Ace Magashule will brief the media on the outcomes of the Special NWC including announcement on the Premier candidate for the North West Province,” the party said. The briefing will also include a status update on the upcoming regional and provincial conferences. Last month Supra Mahumapelo resigned as North West Premier, opting to take early retirement, this as he came under immense pressure from within the ANC and also the public over his controversial rein as provincial leader. – African News Agency (ANA)
