PARLIAMENT, June 21 (ANA) – Cabinet sees the blocking of highways in South Africa by protestors as economic sabotage, Communications Minister Nomvula Mokonyane said on Thursday. Briefing the media on Wednesday’s fortnightly cabinet meeting, Mokonyane condemned the blocking of major highways, a critical part of the country’s transport infrastructure, and called on law enforcment agencies to not tolerate “criminal acts of disruption”. “We view these acts as acts of economic sabotage…,” she said. Mokonyane said Cabinet urged people to use other means to air their grievances and not “sabotage economic life, including the rights of movement of individuals that are not part of the demonstration”. The N3 highway linking Durban and Johannesburg was blocked again this week after being intermittently closed due to violent protests this year. Police said dozens of truck drivers blocked the N3 highway on Wednesday at Van Reenen’s Pass in Durban in protest against the employment of foreign nationals. The N2 between George and Knysna was also closed on Wednesday after protestors set two trucks alight. – African News Agency (ANA)
