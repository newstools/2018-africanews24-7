Zodidi Mhlana JOHANNESBURG- The Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) is intervening in the ongoing Metrobus strike after talks between involved parties deadlocked. Since Tuesday last week, Metrobus commuters have been forced to seek alternative transport after some drivers affiliated to the Democratic Municipal and Allied Workers Union of South Africa downed tools. Parties involved in the matter are meeting today. The Democratic Municipal and Allied Workers Union of South Africa disrupted bus services and threatened drivers not affiliated to the union from working. Metrobus said that the Democratic Municipal and Allied Workers Union of South Africa is demanding to be recognised, but the company said the union “does not meet the requirements that can ensure their recognition.” Metrobus spokesperson Goodwill Shiburi on Tuesday said that the union has requested CCMA to intervene in the issue. “After we were unable to solve the impasse during last week’s meeting, the issue was referred to the CCMA. We cannot sign an agreement with an unrecognised union. The safety of our passengers and drivers remains a top priority for now,” he said. Shiburi said he was not aware of when bus drivers would be back to work. Two Metrobus drivers and passengers have been assaulted since the industrial action began. Six buses from the company have also been stoned by striking drivers. The union is also demanding that Metrobus should pay salary progression for inexperienced drivers. The bus company has been beset by problems lately, three weeks ago angry commuters blocked buses from operating in and around Gandhi Square complaining about late and unreliable buses. Commuters used dustbins and other objects to block buses from entering and exiting Ghandi Square claiming that Metro buses were often delayed or not arriving at all. @Mhlana
