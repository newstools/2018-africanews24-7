JOHANNESBURG, June 23 – There is a low probability of rotational load shedding on Saturday, after several generating units were returned to service, electricity parastatal Eskom said. “We continue to encourage residents and businesses to use electricity sparingly by switching off geysers during the day, especially during peak periods [7 am to 10 am and 6 pm to 9 pm], as well as all non-essential lighting and electricity appliances,” Eskom said in a statement. In the event that load shedding became necessary, Eskom and municipalities would use the published rotational load shedding schedules. For Eskom customers, these schedules are available on the Eskom website (http://loadshedding.eskom.co.za). Eskom customers can also contact the customer contact centre at 0860-037-566. – African News Agency (ANA)
