JOHANNESBURG, June 1 – Just two years ago, a 19-year-old Siphesihle Ndlovu had a dream and ambition to one day play professional football. At that time, Ndlovu was going through the SAB League skills course. Two years later, Ndlovu is the best midfielder in the country, and the best young player at the moment. This was confirmed by the Premier Soccer League this week at their awards ceremony, as the Maritzburg United star walked away with Midfielder of the Season and Young Player of the Season awards. “I was not a confident person. I did not even think I would make it this far. But I had the dream and I wanted to play at the highest level,” Ndlovu said. “Many things helped when I was younger. The SAB League helped my career, and Roger De Sa made it all possible when he gave me my debut. It is obviously coach Fadlu Davids who made me believe in my talent and for now, I am just over the moon.” In winning the Midfielder of the Year award, Ndlovu beat competition from Bafana Bafana midfielder, Hlompho Kekana and Orlando Pirates man, Musa Nyatama. The 21-year-old only managed the feat in what was his first full season in the Premiership. ANA
