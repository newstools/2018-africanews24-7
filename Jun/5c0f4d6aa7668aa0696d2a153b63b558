OSTRAVA, Czech Republic, June 14 – Akani Simbine (Tuks) raced to a second place finish in the 100m on Wednesday during the IAAF World Challenge Meeting in Ostrava, Czech Republic. The World Champion, Justin Gatlin (USA), won running 10.03. Simbine’s time was 10.13 with Mike Rodgers (USA) third in 10.15. Rodgers is so far this season the second fastest sprinter having clocked a time of 9.92 ten days ago in Praha. Werner Prinsloo (coach) is, for now, satisfied with Simbine’s performance. According to him, Simbine managed to execute his race much better than he did during the Rome Diamond League Meeting where he was fifth also running 10.13. Usually, by this time of the season, Simbine would have clocked at least one sub-ten second race. His best time is 10.03. It is surprising how few athletes have dipped under ten seconds. Only nine have been able to do so this season. “There are still a few small things we need to work on before Akani is “firing” on all cylinders. Our goal is that he should be at his best at the African Championships as he wants to medal,” said Prinsloo. “That is why for now we are not too concerned about running fast times. If he can get a top three finish like he did last night, it is a job well done as far as I am concerned. Akani will compete in few more races than originally planned.” Luvo Manyonga was beaten in the long jump again by Cuba’s Juan Miguel Echevarria. The 19-year old jumped 8.66m, with the South African finishing second with a best effort of 8.31m. Ruswahl Samaai was third jumping 8.15m. Anaso Jobodwana was sixth in the 200m running 20.48 while Antonio Alkana finished sixth in the 110m-hurdles (13.65s). Meanwhile, Wenda Nel won the 400m-hurdles in Espoo, Finland. Her winning time was 56.10. “At least it is a much better performance than my last race where my time was 57.47. Last night I felt like I could have run 55 seconds, but unfortunately, I made a few mistakes especially going over the last hurdle,” said Nel whose next race is on June 26 in Copenhagen. – African News Agency (ANA)
