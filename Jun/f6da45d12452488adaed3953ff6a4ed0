By Staff Reporter JOHANNESBURG-  ANC Deputy Secretary-General has condemned EFF deputy president Floyd Shivambu who yesterday objected to Treasury’s Ismail Momoniat’s presence at a finance committee meeting because he was ‘un-African’. The EFF’s second-in-command drew widespread criticism for his attack of Momoniat, who has served National Treasury for over 20 years and has been a key figure in the anti-apartheid movement. Duarte said: “I have known comrade Momoniat for over four decades, and whilst I may differ sharply with some of his views on our economy and developmental state, I could never stand aloof and allow him to be asked to leave a meeting because he is an Indian.” Added Duarte: “The blatant racist and narrow nationalist stance of the EFF is perhaps the only positive element of the racist and irrational rave by Shivambu. It does raise some questions about the manner in which MPs understand their responsibility to protect and defend our Constitution, particularly the assertion that we build a non-racial non-sexist united and democratic South Africa.” Duarte concluded: “ Comrade Momo is not racist. I say this without fear of contradiction. If anything comrade Momo showers accolades or disdain in equal measure irrespective of colour class or creed.”
