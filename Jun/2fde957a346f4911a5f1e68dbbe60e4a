CAPE TOWN, June 7 – Convicted murderer Henri van Breda was on Thursday sentenced to three life terms for the murders of his parents and older brother, 15 years for the attempted murder of his sister and 12 months for defeating the ends of justice. Western Cape High Court Judge Siraj Desai handed down the sentence on the 23-year-old Van Breda for the January 2015 attack on his family at the family home in the De Zalze security estate in Stellenbosch. Van Breda is set to appeal on June 27. Throughout the trial, Van Breda maintained his innocence, claiming instead that a laughing, axe-wielding attacker, also armed with a knife, was behind the murders. However, Judge Desai dismissed his version as “nonsensical” and found him guilty on three counts of murder, one of attempted murder, as well as defeating the ends of justice. – African News Agency (ANA)
