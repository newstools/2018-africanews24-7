PRETORIA, June 25 (ANA) – Metrorail said that its train service for the Monday morning peak was disrupted between Eerste Fabrieke-Pienaarspoort stations in Mamelodi due to violent community protests. “The community is alledgely protesting  for municipality service delivery issues  and have resorted to blocking the railway tracks between Mamelodi Gardens and Pienaarspoort stations, making it impossible for trains to operate past Eerste Fabrieke station,” Metrorail spokesperson Lillian Mofokeng said in a statement. “Subsequently, all Pienaarspoort trains are turning at Eerste Fabrieke station until it is safe to run trains beyond Eerste Fabrieke station.” Mofokeng said Metrorail management would advise commuters to make alternative transport arrangements to get to Eerste Fabrieke station as they take the safety of commuters very seriously. – African News Agency (ANA)
