JOHANNESBURG, June 19 – KwaZulu-Natal MEC for Transport Mxolisi Kaunda on Tuesday condemned the torching of two trucks and the blockading of the N2 between Mtubatuba and Hluhluwe in the northern part of the province earlier in the morning. Members of the Mfekayi community ordered truck drivers to dump coal and manure on the N2 highway near the Zamimpilo market in Mtubatuba in the early hours of Tuesday morning, blocking the highway for hours. They were protesting against the slow progress of service delivery in the area. Among other demands, residents want a police station and a clinic built in the area, as well as provision of government-subsidized houses, known as RDP houses. At least two other trucks were looted of goods on the N2 as the protest over poor services turned violent. Kaunda called for calm and asked the law enforcement agencies to heighten visibility in the area, particularly the N2 Freeway between Hluhluwe and Mtubatuba, warning community members against causing havoc and damage to public or private property. “Torching of trucks and blocking the N2 freeway is an act of criminality. As the government we will not tolerate such blatant disrespect of the rule of law,” Kaunda said. “The N2 freeway is a gateway to our neighboring countries such as Swaziland and Mozambique and therefore the blockading of this route disrupts the transportation of many goods which are destined to these countries which are our trade partners.” Police successfully dispersed protesters who blockaded the highway without any injuries. Kaunda said the police were on the ground to bring to book those responsible for torching trucks. – African News Agency (ANA)
