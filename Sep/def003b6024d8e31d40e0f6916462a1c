Solly Makganoto Radio station Power 98.7 on Tuesday confirmed that JJ Tabane has been removed as host of the ‘Power Perspective’ show. This follows Tabane’s suspension over his tweets on damning evidence given at the state capture inquiry by acting government spokeswoman, Phumla Williams against former minister Faith Muthambi. “We have considered the events that led to his suspension as well as the subsequent developments and have decided to terminate our relationship with Mr Tabane on 18 September 2018,” the station said in a statement on Tuesday. Tabane’s woes started with a tweet in which he responded to Williams’s tearful testimony about Muthambi’s reign of terror and ”torture” at the department of Government Communications and Information System (GCIS). He tweeted: ”Faith Muthambi …this is a horror story,” after which public relations guru Chris Vick replied in a tweet that Tabane had been complacent during Muthambi’s perceived recklessness. In a heated radio interview last week, Vick accused the radio host of doing nothing as managers such as Williams were subjected to the former minister’s reign of terror at GCIS. Tabane’s company had been hired by Muthambi to come up with an improved communication strategy for government. Vick said he formed part of the appointed team, and resigned as he found it hard to work under Muthambi. Tabane defended his work and told Vick that he did what he was hired to do and was proud to have come up with a strategy as required, and that he was not aware of Muthambi’s ”torture” of GCIS staffers. “We have notified Mr Tabane that his agreement with POWER 98.7 is terminated with immediate effect.” “POWER 98.7 will communicate the new host of POWER Perspective once it has concluded its recruitment processes.”
