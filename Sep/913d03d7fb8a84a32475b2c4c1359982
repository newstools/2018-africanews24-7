BRISBANE, Australia, September 5 – The Springboks have made some adjustments to their preparations for Saturday’s Rugby Championship match against the Wallabies in Brisbane, Australia. The two sides meet at 8pm (noon SA time) on Saturday at the Suncorp Stadium in the Queensland capital. Captain Siya Kolisi and his team have been training in high-intensity sessions on Monday and Tuesday, with the Springbok coaches adjusting the team’s training and activity schedule in order to simulate preparations for the evening kick-off. “Back home we always play in the late afternoon while over the next two weeks we will be playing in the evening, which obviously means that on match days the boys will be active much later in the day,” said Bok assistant coach Mzwandile Stick. “As part of our preparations for the evening kick-off, we have therefore moved our practice sessions and even some gym workouts to later slots in the day. “For instance, our field sessions started at 4 pm on both days, while Aled (Walters, SA Rugby’s Head of Athletic Performance) also took the players for a gym workout at around 7.30pm on Monday.” Following Wednesday’s training free day, the Springbok squad will go through another late afternoon session on Thursday at the Churchie Grammar School, and they then round off preparations for the week on Friday when the captain’s run is staged at the match venue. The match 23 for the Test will be announced on Thursday morning (SA time). – African News Agency (ANA
