DURBAN, September 8 – Bafana Bafana’s week started on a wrong footing with four players withdrawing due to injuries (Hlompho Kekana, Bongani Zungu, Themba Zwane, Lebo Mothiba), forcing coach Stuart Baxter to call up replacements (Tiyani Mabunda, Aubrey Modiba, Vincent Pule, Mxolisi Macuphu). But all that was forgotten when the squad completed their preparations on Friday at the Moses Mabhida Stadium, the venue where they will face Libya in the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers on Saturday (start 15h00). Midweek they also managed to squeeze in a practice match against PSL side Amazulu, whom they beat 2-0, with goals from Bradley Grobler and Pule. This will be the first-ever meeting between the Bafana Bafana and The Mediterranean Knights – both sides are on three points each after winning their opening matches in the qualifiers. Libya disposed of the Seychelles 5-1 to shoot to the top of Group E, while South Africa brushed aside Nigeria 2-0 to lie in second place. – African News Agency (ANA)
