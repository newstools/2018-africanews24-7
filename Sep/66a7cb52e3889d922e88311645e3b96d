DURBAN, September 10 â€“ South Africa missed an opportunity to top the log when they were held to a goalless draw by Libya in their Group E Africa Cup of Nations qualifier in Durban over the weekend. Bafana Bafana will now have to wait until mid-October when they play home and away against Seychelles who were thumped 3-0 by Nigeria in the other Group E fixture over the weekend. The matches against Seychelles, at over 100 spots below South Africa in the Fifa rankings at a lowly 188th position, should be the perfect opportunity for Bafana to grab six points. Bafana are currently ranked 74th in the Fifa rankings. Bafana have four points after two games, the same total as Libya but behind only on goal difference. Nigeria is in third place with three points. The Super Eagles, who lost their opening clash 2-0 to South Africa, revived their campaign with goals from Ahmed Musa, Chidozie Awazeim and Odion Ighalo. This is the second loss for the Islanders as they were thumped 5-1 by Libya in the first round of fixtures. Nigeria and Libya will also clash in home and away fixtures next month. South Africa will host the first clash on October 13, followed by the second match on October 16 away in Seychelles. (ANA)
