JOHANNESBURG, September 11 – The state capture commission of inquiry, that was scheduled to resume on Wednesday, has been postponed until further notice. “Please note that there will be no sitting tomorrow [Wednesday]. I will issue another statement tomorrow with regards to the programme moving forward as indicated,” commission spokesman Mbuyiselo Stemela said in a statement on Tuesday. Former public enterprises minister Barbara Hogan was set to give evidence Wednesday. Commission chairman Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo was also expected to rule on requests by the Gupta family and former president Jacob Zuma’s son Duduzane, on whether they would be allowed to cross-examine witnesses. It was not yet clear why the Wednesday sitting was postponed. The inquiry has heard damning evidence from witnesses who revealed the extent of the fugitive Gupta’s families influence on Zuma and his son Duduzane, who was the family’s business partner and sometimes acted as a proxy. The commission emanated from an explosive report by former public protector Thuli Madonsela, released in 2016. It revealed that there was an improper and possibly corrupt relationship between the Guptas and several key members of Zuma’s inner-circle, including parastatal bosses and ministers. The probe showed how the Gupta brothers — Tony, Ajay and Atul — used their influence with Zuma to obtain lucrative state contracts, raking in billions in the process. Former deputy finance minister Mcebisi Jonas revealed to the Zondo-led commission that the family told him they had raked in R6 billion from the State and wanted to increase that to R8 billion. – African News Agency (ANA)
