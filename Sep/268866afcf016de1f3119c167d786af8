JOHANNESBURG, September  10 – Luxury goods firm Richemont said on Monday it had appointed current group chief operating officer Jérôme Lambert as chief executive officer with immediate effect. Lambert has had an extensive career with Richemont — a Switzerland-based company founded by South African businessman Johann Rupert — having led Jaeger-LeCoultre and Montblanc and overseen the group’s specialist watchmakers, Montblanc and its fashion and accessories businesses prior to taking on the role of COO last year. “Jérôme’s new role sees him taking responsibility for the group’s future growth at a time when consumer habits are changing significantly,” said Rupert, who is chairman of Richemont. “As we position the group to meet these challenges, he will lead the development of strategic plans reflecting the long-term objectives and priorities established by the board.” (ANA)
