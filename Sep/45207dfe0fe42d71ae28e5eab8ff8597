Simphiwe Zungu The lawyers of former South African Airways chair Dudu Myeni are celebrating a victory, this after a dossier implicating former SAA CEO Coleman Andrews of corruption and bribery was hand-delivered to the Hawks offices on Wednesday. Myeni had been vocal against Andrews’ selling of SAA’s aircrafts to a foreign company. Out of 60 aircrafts, 51 aircrafts were sold with SAA leasing the aircrafts from the company it had sold it to. Myeni’s attorneys have wasted no time in taking her victory to court in a civil litigation attempt against the newspapers which published stories lamenting the fall of the state-owned airline to be Myeni’s fault Myeni, who served two terms as chairperson was exonerated by the report investigating competition and corruption in the airline industry. Myeni has called on the public protector and parliaments standing committee on public accounts(SCOPA) to bring the board and the minister at the time of Andrews term to account. According to Myeni’s legal team, Andrews reported to a board and a minister in the cabinet and could not be complicit in corruption alone. Myeni received nationwide messages of support after news of the dossier broke but yesterday a social media storm broke out when a social media user accused Myeni of receiving ‘benefits’ from security company Bosasa. Myeni’s followers quickly hit back saying “people are going to try and connect Dudu Myeni to Bosasa and all other else because she has been cleared of any wrongdoing at SAA. White media is going to make her a subject to avoid the reality of her victory”. When asked if they would sue former Secretary-General Gwede Mantashe for comments made against Myeni, her lawyers, ka Mbonani attorneys responded “Anything is possible at this stage. Ms Myeni was deeply hurt by the false news perpetuated against her”
