JOHANNESBURG – South African power utility Eskom said on Monday that it had less than 20 days of coal supplies at 10 of its 15 coal-fired power stations, posing a threat to national power supplies. “Out of our 15 coal-fired power stations, 10 of them have less than 20 days. Clearly, this is contrary to what the regulator has prescribed,” Eskom spokesman Khulu Phasiwe said. Cash-strapped Eskom is critical to Africa’s most industrialised economy as it supplies more than 90 percent of its power and is one of its most indebted state firms.  – (Reuters)
