JOHANNESBURG, September 18 – The Constitutional Court on Tuesday decriminalised the private use of dagga in South Africa. The highest court in South Africa also ordered Parliament to change a section of the Medicine Controls Act within 24 months. The ConCourt handed down the historic judgment on Tuesday confirming the ruling of another court ruled that it was legal for South Africans to grow a little weed – better known locally as dagga – for personal use. Last year in March, Justice Dennis Davis handed down a judgment in the Western Cape High Court that declared sections of the  Drugs and Drug Trafficking Act invalid and unconstitutional after an application brought by Rastafarian lawyer Gareth Prince, an advocate for the decriminalisation of marijuana. Prince argued that the criminalisation of dagga use and possession was a violation of the right to equality, dignity, and freedom of religion. Justice Davis suspended the order of invalidity on the use of cannabis until it could be confirmed by the Constitutional Court. The National Prosecuting Authority and other government departments opposed to the legalisation of dagga warning of harmful effects. However, on Tuesday the Concourt agreed with Justice Davies and decriminalised the private use of marijuana. – African News Agency (ANA)
