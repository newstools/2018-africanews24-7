Sello Theletsane JOHANNESBURG- Controversial businessman, Mzwanele Manyi on Thursday was ordered by the Johannesburg Labour Court to reinstate employees that lost their jobs when Afro Worldview shutdown. Manyi’s Infinity Networks Media was taken to court by the Communications Workers’ Union. According to the Labour Court, Infinity Networks Media breached a section of Labour Acts due to “failure to engage in a retrenchment process”. “The first respondent (Infinity Media Networks) is ordered to reinstate those of the second to further applicants with whom it has terminated its employment relationship with immediate effect until it has complied with a far consultation process in terms of sections 189 and 189A of the Labour Relation Act,” the ruling read. Manyi was further ordered to pay the applicant’s legal fees. Afro Worldview’s contract termination by MutliChoice came just a few weeks after Manyi had decided to close down the daily newspaper, AfroVoice, formerly known as ‘The New Age’, and filed for liquidation.
