JOHANNESBURG, September 5 – Firefighters were on the scene at a glue factory which caught fire in Kya Sands near Lanseria, north of Johannesburg on Wednesday morning, an emergency services spokesperson said. Nana Radebe, the spokeswoman for emergency management services at the City of Johannesburg, said firefighters had contained the fire which broke out just before 05h30. “Luckily there were no injuries. We have dispatched three fire engines and 20 firefighters,” Radebe said, adding that there would be an investigation into the cause. Images and footage of raging fire from the burning factory trended on social media, with some people speculating that the fire could be linked to a protest in Kya Sands, which is prone to demonstrations over poor services. – African News Agency (ANA)
