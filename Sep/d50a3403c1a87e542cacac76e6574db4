Staff Reporter JOHANNESBURG- “The People’s Poet” Mzwakhe Mbuli blast the recent decriminalization of dagga by the Constitutional Court. In his poem, Mbuli accuses the government of serious misjudgment of priorities. This was in response to the country’s highest court ruling a few days ago that the personal use of cannabis is not a criminal offence. In a unanimous decision, the court ruled that the ban on private possession and consumption, and cultivation of the plant for own use is unconstitutional. It found that the country’s cannabis ban infringed on section 14 of the South African constitution which gives all citizens the right to privacy.
