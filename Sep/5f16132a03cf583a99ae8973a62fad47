Sello Theletsane JOHANNESBURG- South African have reacted in outrage following the news that the country is in recession. Most social media users attacked President Cyril Ramaphosa for the terrible economic state that the country finds itself in. On Wednesday, the rand fell to a record low R15.50 to the US Dollar, losing 6.5 percent this week alone. This news caught many South Africans by surprise since taking over as the country’s president in February, Ramaphosa was sold to South Africans by critics of his predecessor Jacob Zuma as the man who could solve the country’s economic problems, however, this optimism has come to nought. See some of the tweets and quotes below:  #Recession

Now we are in recession under the leadership of educated business billionaire”~IK Dlamini #recession #LandExpropriation — Sean GuptaK@ffir in Sight Goss (@GosSgafc) September 4, 2018  This is President #Ramaphosa and his #ThumaMina brigade trying to solve problems in our country…#Recession #sabcnews pic.twitter.com/EODUBlaIo5 — Umfana Uphethi Magic (@Pampie59) September 5, 2018  Can someone dig @JacksonMthembu_ ; @zizikodwa, @GwedeMantashe1 and their New Dawn Nasrec buddies wherever they are hiding and ask them why we are in recession. #Recession #Rand #Ramaphosa — Ramaphosa’s day is coming (@BubuLango) September 5, 2018  So u were tricked by #SaveSA to believe that if u remove Zuma, the Rand will be stronger & all will be perfect forever after. This #Recession will teach u to stop joining hands with white capitalists when removing black leaders. I bet they’ll soon tell u to remove CR & u will. pic.twitter.com/VwJr5bSNap — White Man Confession (@ConfessionWhite) September 5, 2018  White Monopoly Capital has failed to create jobs, grow the economy and they are sitting on their cash. Cash reserves in the JSE’s largest 50 companies has increased from R242bn to R1.8 trillion between 2005 and 2017. This is what causing the #Recession yet they cry the loudest pic.twitter.com/hGP78C24CA — African (@ali_naka) September 5, 2018  Can you leave Comrade President Zuma in peace and deal with your #Recession of New dawn
