NAIROBI – Ethiopian and Eritrean leaders reopened Ethiopia’s embassy in the Eritrean capital Asmara on Thursday, state-affiliated Ethiopian Fana Broadcasting said. Fana Broadcasting said Ethiopia’s Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and Eritrea’s President Isaias Afwerki re-opened the embassy in a brief ceremony. Since signing an agreement in Asmara on July 9 to restore ties, Eritrean and Ethiopian leaders have moved swiftly to sweep away two decades of hostility since conflict erupted between the two neighbours in the Horn of Africa in 1998.  -(Reuters)
