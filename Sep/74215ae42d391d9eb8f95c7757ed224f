ALGHERO, Italy, September 21 –  Wheelchair tennis player Donald Ramphadi, South African rising quad player, blew away the world No 4 Sugeno Koji from Japan in straight sets to reach the finals on his Sardinia Open debut in Italy on Friday. The 25-year-old Ramphadi who hails from Tzaneen in Limpopo produced a stunning display to end Koji’s remarkable run with a 6-4 6-1 in Alghero win to book a place in his first International Tennis Federation (ITF) 1 final. Koji has been in a great form this season upsetting world No 1 American David Wagner in the BNP Paribas Open de France semi-final and edging out world No 3 Brit’s Andy Lapthorne in the final of the same tournament, but the South African proved to be his downfall on Friday. Ramphadi and doubles partner Lucas Sithole are also in the quads doubles final. (ANA)
