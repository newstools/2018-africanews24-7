JOHANNESBURG, September 4 – Coach Giovanni Solinas is adamant Kaizer Chiefs haven’t yet hit peak form this season. Chiefs currently occupy 13th position in the Premiership standings, after four draws and a defeat in five attempts. “I believe in this team and I fully believe that, with time, we will get it right. I am optimistic about the future. The best of Kaizer Chiefs is coming,” said Solinas. They were recently removed from MTN8 title contention by a 3-2 semi-final aggregate loss to SuperSport United. “We didn’t play well in the first half, but we did much better in the second half, creating chances. It was disappointing to see SuperSport United score the goal,” added Solinas. “We lost an opportunity to win a trophy, and I understand that our supporters are not happy with the result. The same is true for me.” “There is, however, a lot of room for improvement and the Fifa international break will give us some time to work at training on certain aspects of our game.” – African News Agency (ANA)
