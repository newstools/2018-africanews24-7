Justice Pitso We all have to agree that our revolution is under threat. White monopoly is at an offensive to undermine our struggle for radical economic transformation. The headlines by the Sunday Times today is nothing else but a perpetuation of treacherous lies by the White Monopoly with the intent to sow division with the ranks of the movement and our people. One was so shocked that none of the dominant media houses has reported about the report which is clearing Cde Dudu Myeni and implicating the former management of the SAA for the graft corruption over our Airline. We need to ask a question as to why the white-dominated media is so quiet about the issue which is of national importance. We have to reject all the attempts by the white monopoly to dictate the pace and the direction of our national democratic revolution. We have to fight to the end and remain unapologetic to our enemies. We have to unmask those who are whitewashing white monopoly capital to derail the victories of the struggle of our people for radical economic transformation. Justice Pitso is a manager in the Office of ANC Secretary General.Â He writes in his personal capacity.
