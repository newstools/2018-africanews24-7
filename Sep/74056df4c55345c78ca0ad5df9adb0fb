BLOEMFONTEIN, September 18 – Fresh from their first Absa Premiership win this season in Cape Town over the weekend, Kaizer Chiefs have arrived in the Free State with loads of confidence. Chiefs coach Giovanni Solinas said on return from Cape Town, the squad only “worked on some tactical preparations” before setting off to the Free State for Tuesday night’s clash against Free State Stars at Bethlehem’s Goble Park. It’s a pitch that Solinas knows well as he had two stints at Stars and will make a return to his old stomping ground. “The commitment is high and the concentration is excellent,” Solinas said. “I am happy with the players’ effort in the training sessions. “Free State Stars are a difficult side and we will respect them. The game will be special, as playing against my former club in their backyard will be emotional. “Stars introduced me to South African football. So it can’t be business as usual. I support them when they play against other teams. “We need to win at home and away. We will use the same philosophy. We want to dominate and play well. We will play attacking football.” The kick-off is at 7.30pm. (ANA)
