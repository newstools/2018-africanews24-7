DURBAN, September 9 – KwaZulu-Natal police on Sunday warned the public of a scam in the Empangeni area near Richards Bay in which at least a dozen people have been defrauded when they paid a large amount of money to apply for teacher jobs advertised on social media. Empangeni police are investigating a case of fraud where unemployed people were scammed through fake job opportunities offered at one of the schools in the Dondotha area, Captain Nqobile Gwala said. It was alleged that teaching posts were advertised on social media. The advert required candidates to deposit an amount of R2850 into a money market account. After applicants deposited the requested cash they discovered they had been scammed. A case of fraud had been opened at Empangeni police station after 12 people claimed that they were defrauded of more than R34,000. “We are appealing to the public not to pay any money for job opportunities in government, as this is not a requirement. Applicants must also do their research and satisfy themselves that the job opportunities advertised are real and not fake. “We are also appealing to anyone else who was defrauded to come forward and submit their statement to the investigating officer. Victims should contact the station commander Brigadier Thango on 035-901-5805/6,” Gwala said. – African News Agency (ANA)
