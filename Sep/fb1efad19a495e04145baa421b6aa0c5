PARLIAMENT, September 4 – If government embarks on a plan to expropriate land without compensation recklessly and in arbitrary manner food prices could soar by 100 percent, South Africa’s Agricultural Business Chamber (Agbiz) warned members of Parliament (MPs) on Tuesday. Briefing Parliament’s Constitutional Review Committee — which is looking into whether section 25 of the Constitution needs changing to allow for the expropriation of land without compensation — Agbiz legal adviser Theo Boshoff said land expropriation could have unintended economic consequences. He said agriculture needed financial institutions to fund inputs, but that financing was dependent on farmers providing collateral. According to Agbiz, the total farm debt stood at R197 billion, with 75 percent of this collateralised through the value of land. Boshoff said if the land is expropriated and commercial farmers’ finance fail their operations, it could lead to production losses. “Now, if they struggle to get finance and production goes down to the extent that we don’t produce enough to meet our own demands and we need to import food then the cost of imported food is of course significantly more than what we can produce locally, so in other words if the production goes down to that extent food prices will rise,” he said. He added that in a worst-case scenario food prices could soar by 100 percent. Agbiz, said Boshoff, supported land reform but said section 25 of the Constitution did not need changing as it already gave government powers to expropriate. He said what has been lacking has been the political will to implement the provisions of section 25 “within the context of land reform”. The lack of legal precedent with regard to expropriating land was also problematic. “Only after the just and equitable compensation principle has been tested by the State and adjudicated upon in court can a meaningful assessment be made.” – African News Agency (ANA)
