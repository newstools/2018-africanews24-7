BRITS, September 3 – Police used rubber bullets to disperse protesting residents of Bethanie outside Brits on Monday. The protesters said their ire was aimed at Glencore’s Rhovan mine in Bethanie, which community leader Lesego Tselankoe accused of failing to implement its social labour plan (SLP). “This mine has not contributed to the community in the whole time they have been here. They promised to fix the toilets in our schools as part of their short-term planning but that has not materialised. This mine has not to let us in on their SLP,” Tselankoe said. As a result of the protests schools were closed, buses and taxis were not operating. – African News Agency (ANA)
